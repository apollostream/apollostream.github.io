### About me

I'm Michael L. Thompson, an expert in Bayesian and probabilistic modeling applied in deriving insights into and predicting behaviors of people, markets, products and processes in the consumer goods industry and the chemical/petroleum process industries.

* To see what I've published, check out [my Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TCTN05QAAAAJ&hl=en).
* I also curate Flipboard mashup magazines: ["Bayesian"](http://flip.it/aqYcRC) and ["Cognitive Computing"](http://flip.it/anlXoL).

### About the blog

This blog intends to showcase what intellectual honesty looks like in the analysis of topics and propositions that pique my interest.  Topics range from politics to sports to pop culture -- the type of stuff folks like to argue about, and the type of things I'd like to know more about.

The catch: The analyses presented in this blog are all generated by AI -- a reasoning LLM augmented with search, RAG, and multiple rounds of create-critique-revise prompting. (My go-to AI system, for the moment, is [Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai.).)

Mind you, an AI LLM scaffolded with extensive knowledge about the domain and the methodology that I've crafted over the past 3 years: the **"Bayesian Framework of Intellectual Honesty" (BFIH) -- pronounced "beefy".**

I've compiled a treatise on the methodology that I compel the AI agent to follow:

* ["Treatise on Intellectual Honesty"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a1kWi9O42awqfXg_8pdJwB4F7autrrUx/view?usp=sharing)

Whenever you're put off by the conclusions that the BFIH AI agent arrives at, dive deeper into its analysis to see the multiple perspectives it adopted, the background knowledge it set as its initial context, the many alternative hypotheses it considered, the extensive factual observations it gathered from a broad variety of sources, and the rigor of its inferential processes.  **I bet you'll learn something!**

And, if this all works as intended, though you may not change your mind -- i.e., **_what you think_** -- _you'll change **how you think** about debatable topics_.
