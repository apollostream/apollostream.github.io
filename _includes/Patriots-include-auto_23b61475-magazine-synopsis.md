## Opening

In the modern NFL, it’s rare to find a number that makes even hardened analysts blink. One did: the Patriots’ 2025 regular-season opponents finished with a combined .391 winning percentage—reported as the lowest in the league and tied for the third-easiest slate in roughly half a century of comparable records-keeping [1][17]. At the same time, New England didn’t look like a flimsy frontrunner that merely surfed circumstances. They finished with a +170 point differential (490 scored, 320 allowed), the kind of margin that usually belongs to teams that are doing something real, week after week [47].

That combination—historic-looking schedule softness alongside signs of genuine dominance—is exactly where sports arguments become slippery. In Boston bars and on national shows, “luck” becomes either an accusation or a punchline: a way to discount what happened, or a way to explain the parts that don’t fit our preferred story. The Patriots’ 2025–26 run to Super Bowl LX made the stakes of that word unusually clear. They won a lot, often comfortably, sometimes narrowly. They faced opponents who were missing key players at key times. Their quarterback and coaching staff piled up metrics that looked repeatable. And in the background, the league’s scheduling machinery did what it always does: it produced uneven paths that only look “destined” after the standings lock in.

**The result:** when you weigh the season’s best public indicators—schedule difficulty, injury and availability patterns, close-game outcomes, and performance quality—the cleanest account is not that the Patriots rode an unprecedented windfall, and not that they were simply so good that context didn’t matter. It’s that they combined real team strength with a meaningful amount of helpful circumstance that sits in the ordinary range for eventual Super Bowl teams.

That is a less satisfying headline than “EASIEST ROAD EVER” [19], and it’s also less flattering than the pure merit story. But it matches how the NFL tends to work. Even excellent teams usually need some doors to open: a fortuitous matchup here, a healthier roster there, a couple of breaks in games that swing on a handful of snaps. The Patriots’ season offers a useful chance to see how those doors open—where the evidence is firm, where it’s softer, and where the debate is partly about what people want “credit” to mean.

What follows is the anatomy of that path: first the schedule, then the bodies, then the bounces, and finally the uncomfortable question at the center of all luck arguments—how much of what we measure is the thing itself, and how much is the shadow it casts.

## The Evidence

### A soft schedule can be real—and still easy to misunderstand

Start with the part that’s hardest to talk away: multiple independent schedule summaries put New England near the bottom of the league in opponent strength. Beyond the headline .391 opponent win rate [1][17], Pro-Football-Reference lists the Patriots with the league’s lowest strength-of-schedule figure (–4.49), alongside a team rating strong enough to rank sixth overall [35]. Other outlets landed in the same neighborhood: CBS placed their slate 30th of 32 based on prior-year opponent records [39]; Sharp Football Analysis had it as the second-easiest entering the season [9]; and Yahoo cited an in-season adjusted measure that again put New England last in schedule difficulty [2].

If you’re trying to explain why a team reached January with a great record, this is not background noise. It’s an advantage. It often means fewer games against top-tier quarterbacks, fewer weeks where injuries are compounded by elite opponent pressure, and more chances to control games without having to chase ceiling outcomes.

But the schedule story becomes more interesting when you look at what, exactly, “soft” means in an NFL season.

For one thing, the AFC East wasn’t a cartoonishly weak division in the simple sense of “everyone is terrible.” StatMuse lists the division’s combined record at 36–32, comfortably above .500 [8]. And yet divisional context still mattered: New England went 5–1 inside and 9-2 outside the division while the Bills finished 4-2 and 8-3; the Dolphins 3-3 and 4–7; and the Jets 0-6 and 3–8 [12]. Over multiple seasons, the AFC East has also graded out as a relatively weak environment outside divisional play—sixth out of eight divisions since 2020 by non-divisional win percentage [25]. These can both be true at once: a division can be “fine” in aggregate while still offering one team a runway because two neighbors are rebuilding.

For another thing, schedule difficulty is partly a retrospective label. It’s not just “who was on the calendar,” but “what those teams turned out to be,” including how healthy they were when you played them. That matters because it shapes the kind of claim you can honestly make. If you argue the Patriots had an easy schedule in May, you’re mostly recycling last year’s records—which several analysts have shown are weak predictors of what the next season’s schedule will feel like in practice [53][60]. If you argue it in February, you’re leaning on realized outcomes that already incorporate injuries, random breaks, and the same close-game variance people are fighting about.

That’s not a reason to discard schedule metrics; it’s a reason to treat them as one layer rather than the whole story. The strongest version of the schedule evidence here is not the preseason projections. It’s the convergence of several end-of-season summaries pointing in the same direction: New England’s path through the regular season was easier than most contenders’ paths [1][2][35]. The weaker version is the grander moral conclusion sometimes drawn from that fact—that ease itself explains everything, or that it automatically delegitimizes what followed. The evidence doesn’t demand either leap.

### The most underrated advantage in football is simply having your players

If the schedule evidence tells you the Patriots faced fewer elite teams, the health evidence tells you something more actionable: they faced fewer weeks in which their own identity had to change because the lineup changed.

Sports Info Solutions ranked New England the fifth-healthiest team in 2025, with 59 games missed and 154 points of “value lost” to injury [6]. In their Wild Card game, the Patriots’ own injury report listed only one starter as unavailable [31]. Those aren’t just trivia. They are a map of how often the coaching staff got to run the plan they built, rather than the emergency version.

Health, of course, is not one thing. Some of it is conditioning and training staff quality. Some of it is roster depth—good teams can lose a starter and keep functioning. And some of it is the part no one controls: whose foot lands on whose ankle in a pile, whether a concussion happens on a routine tackle, whether a “minor” hand injury belongs to a quarterback who needs to throw in tight windows.

The Patriots’ season becomes revealing when you compare their stability to what happened to the opponents they saw in the postseason.

In the Wild Card round, the Chargers arrived with a battered offensive line and a compromised quarterback. Reports out of the team and league coverage described multiple starters missing or limited, including tackles Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt [26]. Boston.com tied those injuries to performance-level consequences, noting the Chargers ended up with the league’s worst pass-block win rate (54%) and second-worst run-block win rate (69%) [42]. Justin Herbert, meanwhile, entered the playoffs after surgery on a broken bone in his non-throwing hand and was described as “not 100 percent” [20]; Associated Press coverage also noted he had played through the injury late in the season [37]. If you want to know how a playoff game tilts before it starts, the fastest route is often through the line and the quarterback’s health.

The Divisional Round brought a similar pattern. The Texans ruled out Nico Collins—described as the team’s leader in targets, receptions, and yards—due to a concussion, along with Justin Watson [21]. Injury reports also flagged offensive line concerns, with tackle Trent Brown questionable [28]. Separately, Houston’s defensive front took hits, including the loss of defensive tackle Mario Edwards to a season-ending pectoral rupture [30]. ESPN commentary on the playoff matchups explicitly framed New England’s defensive success in the context of opponents dealing with weak or depleted trenches [18], and local Houston coverage echoed that emphasis [36].

Then, in the AFC Championship, Denver’s quarterback situation broke open. Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury that forced the Broncos to turn to backups [41]. Additional inactives included key skill-position contributors [22]. No single injury “explains” a conference title game. But it changes what kinds of plays are available, how aggressive a staff can be on fourth down, and how much stress a defense can apply without fear of being punished downfield.

This is where the “luck versus skill” argument becomes less philosophical and more mechanical. The advantage isn’t just that your opponent loses a player. It’s that, across multiple rounds, the opponent’s weaknesses line up with the most leverage-heavy positions in football: quarterback, offensive line, and primary receiving options. New England didn’t choose those injuries, but they benefited from them in ways that are neither imaginary nor all-powerful.

There is also an honest complication embedded here: injury accounting is notoriously easy to botch. A raw “man-games lost” figure can be wildly misleading because it treats all absences as equal and often fails to capture timing and importance. One CBS News San Francisco item illustrates the problem: a blog claimed the Patriots led the league with 245 man-games lost, even as a team like the Giants posted nearly as many and missed the playoffs, underscoring how easily counting methods can produce confident but incoherent conclusions [57]. Cost-based metrics can also mislead; one summary put New England at a relatively modest injury “cost” figure and still deep in the playoffs, which says less about injuries not mattering than about that metric’s ability to translate dollars into wins [58]. And more formal attempts to put point values on injuries suggest that, while injuries matter, their week-to-week impact may be smaller than fan intuition implies—on the order of a couple points per game midseason, versus larger variation in baseline team quality [59].

The right takeaway isn’t “injuries decide everything” or “injuries are excuses.” It’s narrower and more useful: the Patriots enjoyed unusual continuity in their own lineup [6][31], and they met several playoff opponents at moments when those opponents were missing high-leverage players [20][21][41]. That combination is a real competitive edge. The evidence supports it without requiring us to pretend it was destiny or fraud.

### Close games are where randomness hides in plain sight

Even teams that dominate on paper rarely get through a season without a cluster of games decided by a few snaps. Those games are catnip for narrative: “clutch,” “composure,” “championship DNA.” They are also where the league’s inherent variance is most visible, because small events—an extra point, a bad snap, a tipped ball—can swing outcomes that were otherwise evenly matched.

New England’s record in tight games points to help from that variance. Champs or Chumps lists the Patriots at 7–3 in one-score games in 2025, including 2–0 in games decided by three points or fewer [14]. Sports Illustrated counted eight one-score games and described several as involving late swings after earlier leads [13]. Yahoo later flagged the Patriots as having two more one-score wins than expected, marking them as a candidate for regression the following year [32]. And midseason analysis using Pythagorean expectation—a method that estimates expected wins from points scored and allowed—found them about 0.7 wins above expectation at the halfway point (7–2 instead of roughly 6.3–2.7) [7].

Those are not enormous gaps; they’re the kind that exist for many very good teams. That’s precisely why this evidence is informative: it doesn’t require you to believe the Patriots were a once-in-a-generation outlier to believe they got some favorable endings.

The most vivid illustration is a single game, because single games show how this “luck” actually arrives. The Boston Globe described a 24–23 Week 9 win over Atlanta that turned on a missed extra point and a botched snap, framed explicitly as “Lady Luck” intervening [51]. Tom E. Curran’s commentary, republished via Yahoo, made a subtly different point: yes, there were opponent errors and a missed extra point, but this is also the normal texture of an NFL season, and the fact that New England could absorb messy stretches without collapsing reflected growth as well as fortune [52].

That difference matters. A missed extra point is not a repeatable skill for the opponent to keep missing, and it’s not a repeatable strategy for the Patriots to count on. But the capacity to keep playing coherent defense late in a one-point game is more plausibly a team trait. What the evidence can support is a blended statement: the Patriots repeatedly found themselves in games where a couple of low-probability events could swing the result—and in a meaningful number of those games, the swing went their way [14][51].

One more layer makes the close-game story sharper. ESPN Analytics reported that, through Week 12, New England had a defensive-adjusted efficiency rating (DVOA) of –3.6%, described as the second-worst for any 10–2 team since 1978 [16]. That’s the kind of number that fuels the “they’re fake” argument: a great record without great underlying efficiency.

But that statistic doesn’t force the conclusion that the Patriots were a mirage. It forces the question of timing and composition. Efficiency metrics can lag behind real improvement, especially if early games include conservative plans, weather-driven contests, or an offense still finding its shape. They can also disagree with win-loss records when teams are excellent in a few high-leverage situations—red zone defense, late-down execution, turnover avoidance—and merely average elsewhere. In other words, a “record greater than the metric” can mean “lucky,” but it can also mean “built for the moments that decide games.” The Patriots’ season contains enough close-game evidence to make “some luck” the most honest position, without requiring us to declare that all close wins are coin flips.

### The Patriots had performance signals that luck alone can’t fake

If you only looked at schedule and injuries, you could talk yourself into believing the Patriots were passengers. The performance evidence makes that hard.

Start with the quarterback. Next Gen Stats named Drake Maye to its 2025 All-Pro offense and credited him with +203.1 EPA, along with large volumes of downfield and under-pressure completions [45]. Pro Football Focus’s midseason report placed him among the league’s most valuable players and highlighted that New England led the NFL with 61 explosive passes at that point [44]. SB Nation noted a year-over-year jump in explosive plays under Maye—explosive passes rising from 34 to 69, explosive runs from 9 to 16—framing it as a substantive offensive transformation rather than a few isolated highlights [46].

Those kinds of improvements matter because they are the raw material of repeatability. A team that wins with explosive plays and quarterback efficiency is doing something that travels. It is less dependent on a specific opponent’s injury list than a team that wins by getting a few short fields off fumble recoveries.

Coaching and scheme also show up in ways that aren’t just self-serving quotes. The Wall Street Journal profiled offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels as a tactical driver of the Patriots’ offensive revival, describing an approach that turned the unit into one of the league’s most formidable [50]. It’s always possible for a profile to oversell; features are not peer-reviewed papers. But when a narrative about coaching advantage aligns with on-field markers—explosives, quarterback efficiency, point differential—it becomes less like marketing and more like a plausible causal chain.

Then there’s the blunt instrument of point differential. The Patriots’ +170 margin [47] is not what you expect from a team purely living on the right side of coin flips. Over a full season, teams that are truly fraudulent usually don’t outscore opponents by that much. They win narrow, lose big, and eventually get exposed. New England’s profile looks more like a strong team that also received some helpful sequencing: winning a few games that could have gone either way, while also posting enough decisive wins to keep the underlying scoring margin healthy.

Even betting markets and projection systems—hardly perfect, but difficult to bully with narrative—treated the Patriots as a serious contender late. Yahoo reported that ESPN’s FPI gave them a 15.3% chance to reach the Super Bowl and a 6.2% chance to win it, while The Athletic’s model put them at 16% to win [48]. Fox Sports noted that, entering Super Bowl LX, New England sat at +190 odds (about a 34.5% implied chance), second-best in the league as of February 1 [49]. Markets can be wrong, and sometimes they follow the same public storylines everyone else does. But they are also aggregators of injury news, matchup evaluations, and priors about quarterback quality. It’s hard to get to those prices if the collective view is “this is all smoke.”

This is also the point where the pure “it was all skill” story runs into trouble. If the Patriots were simply so good that context didn’t matter, you’d expect the schedule softness, opponent injury patterns, and close-game outperformance to be less prominent in the record. Instead, those factors show up repeatedly in the public data. The best-supported skill narrative isn’t “no luck.” It’s that New England had a strong underlying team—quarterback play, explosive offense, coaching competence—and that those strengths interacted with favorable circumstances in ways that made the run look smoother than it otherwise might have.

### Why reasonable people end up arguing past each other about “luck”

The last piece of evidence isn’t about a specific game. It’s about measurement itself—because many of the loudest “lucky” and “not lucky” claims rest on metrics that are easy to mishandle.

Schedule strength is a prime example. Analysts have repeatedly shown that using prior-year opponent records to forecast schedule difficulty is close to useless. Sharp Football Analysis quantified this by showing preseason strength-of-schedule measures based on prior win-loss records explained only about 5.7% of actual in-season schedule strength (R² = 0.057) [53]. FiveThirtyEight made a similar point more bluntly, calling prior-year opponent win percentage “essentially irrelevant” for predicting upcoming schedule difficulty and team records [60]. The lesson is not that schedules don’t vary—they do—but that our popular way of predicting who will be good is bad at it.

Even in-season or end-of-season schedule measures can swing dramatically as a few opponents rise or fall, and the Boston Globe highlighted that volatility, describing how schedule projections shifted sharply after a single opponent’s performance changed the inputs [54]. Academic work on improved schedule metrics suggests that truly extreme schedules are rarer than casual discourse implies, and that overall variability is modest [62]. Other research notes that the league’s scheduling policy inherently produces differences in schedule difficulty, meaning uneven paths are in part a feature of the system rather than an anomaly requiring conspiracy or cosmic favor [63]. ESPN’s own explainer of the schedule emphasizes the fixed rotational formula that structures opponents year to year [61]. The Patriots didn’t hack the schedule; they landed on a favorable branch of a formula designed to be fair over time, not equal every season.

Injury measurement suffers from similar traps. Fans tend to count injured players; teams experience the loss as a loss of function at specific positions at specific times. Those are not the same. A backup linebacker missing six weeks is not equal to a starting quarterback missing one game. And timing matters: losing a tackle in December can be more consequential than losing him in September, because the margin for error shrinks.

So when people argue “they had all the luck,” they often mean a bundle of things: a schedule that turned out soft, opponents who arrived undermanned, and close games that broke their way. When people argue “they earned it,” they often mean a different bundle: a quarterback who made high-level throws, an offense that generated explosives, and a team that kept functioning under pressure.

Both bundles contain reality. The analytical task is separating what each bundle can legitimately claim. The schedule and injury evidence supports the idea that the Patriots faced an unusually favorable set of opponent conditions [1][6][20][21][41]. The performance evidence supports the idea that they were strong enough to exploit those conditions in ways weaker teams would not [44][45][47]. The close-game evidence supports the idea that a meaningful slice of their record was vulnerable to alternate endings [14][51][32]. And the measurement evidence supports a final, slightly uncomfortable truth: the loudest versions of both stories often lean on simplified metrics that aren’t built to carry moral weight [53][60][57].

## What This Means

The Patriots’ season is most useful not as a referendum on one franchise, but as a case study in how championships are built—and how they’re misread.

First, it offers a practical rule for anyone trying to evaluate a team beyond the standings: **separate “how good are they” from “how hard was it.”** New England’s +170 point differential and quarterback metrics are signals of quality that don’t evaporate because the schedule was light [45][47]. But schedule and opponent availability still shape what a record can mean. When a team’s easiest stretch arrives after midseason—as one schedule tracker noted for New England’s Weeks 8–18 opponents (21–46, .313) [3]—you should expect the win-loss record to become less informative about how they’ll fare against elite opponents.

Second, the injury pattern points toward something organizations quietly plan around: availability is a competitive strategy even when it looks like “luck” from the outside. The Patriots’ continuity—fifth-healthiest by one accounting [6], nearly full strength at key moments [31]—is not automatically a miracle, and it’s not automatically a medical masterpiece. But it suggests a structural advantage that front offices can meaningfully pursue: depth at high-leverage positions, load management where possible, and roster designs that don’t collapse when one player is out. The league’s postseason often becomes a tournament of “who still has their tackles and their quarterback functioning.” The Patriots repeatedly met teams who didn’t [20][42][41]. You can’t control opponent injuries, but you can control how often your own season turns into an improvisation.

Third, close-game performance is where fan intuition needs the most disciplined correction. A 7–3 record in one-score games [14] can absolutely reflect situational competence—red-zone defense, special teams discipline, quarterback decision-making under pressure. It can also reflect bounces that don’t repeat. The honest posture is not cynicism (“they’re frauds”) or romance (“they’re clutch”), but conditional prediction: teams with notable one-score outperformance tend to look less dominant the following year unless there’s a strong underlying efficiency base supporting it [32]. That doesn’t mean the Patriots were destined to regress; it means the fraction of their record that depended on thin margins is the fraction most likely to wobble.

Fourth, the schedule debate hints at a broader problem in sports talk: we use weak metrics as vessels for strong emotions. Preseason schedule rankings based on last year’s records persist because they’re easy to understand, not because they’re accurate [53][60]. Injury “man-games lost” totals persist because they feel concrete, not because they capture impact [57]. The Patriots’ season shows what happens when those simplifications collide with a team that is simultaneously strong and well-situated. People don’t just disagree about the numbers; they disagree about what the numbers are allowed to imply.

For individual fans, that suggests a different way to argue that actually produces insight. Instead of fighting over whether “luck” existed—which it almost always does—argue about *where it entered the system*. Was it primarily the schedule structure [1][35]? The health gap [6][20]? The sequence of a few pivotal plays [51]? Or was the core driver a quarterback-and-scheme leap that would have produced a deep run through many plausible paths [45][50]? Those are sharper questions, and they are answerable in pieces.

For teams, the implications are even more concrete. If you believe the Patriots’ run demonstrates anything replicable, it’s not “hope for luck.” It’s “build the kind of team that turns a modest edge into a runway.” Explosive offense and high-level quarterback play are runway multipliers [44][45]. So is a roster that stays intact. When those factors are present, a softish schedule and an injury-favorable playoff bracket can turn from “nice” into “decisive.” When those factors are absent, the same breaks just produce an early exit with a few memorable highlights.

Finally, for anyone trying to keep intellectual honesty in a sport built on noise, the Patriots’ season argues for humility of a specific kind. Not the performative kind—“who can say, really”—but the mechanical kind: football outcomes are produced by layers, and the layers interact. The more you reduce the story to a single cause, the more likely you are to be confidently wrong.

---

## Closing

The NFL sells parity as a principle, but it delivers it as a distribution. Over time, the schedule formula rotates; talent spreads; teams rise and fall. In any single year, the distribution produces outliers in experience: one team gets a healthier roster, another loses its quarterback in January, another draws a division mid-rebuild. That unevenness isn’t a scandal—it’s the texture of the league.

The Patriots’ 2025–26 path sits inside that texture. You can point to the .391 opponent win percentage and call it absurd [1][17]. You can point to playoff opponents arriving without key linemen, receivers, and quarterbacks and call it timely [20][21][41]. You can point to missed extra points and botched snaps and call it fortune [51]. And you can still look at Maye’s production, the explosive-play profile, the point differential, and the market’s respect and conclude that this was a team built to take advantage of whatever the season put in front of it [45][47][49].

What remains genuinely uncertain isn’t whether the Patriots received help—they did—but where the line sits between “a championship season’s normal breaks” and “a historically extreme run of them.” The evidence can narrow that question without sealing it shut. And that, in its own way, is a useful outcome: a season complicated enough to resist slogans, but clear enough to teach you how to look.
