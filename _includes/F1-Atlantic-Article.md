# The American Formula 1 Paradox: Why 52 Million Fans Don't Actually Watch the Races

*How identity became untethered from behavior—and what that reveals about how Americans consume global culture*

---

## The Curious Gap

There's a striking anomaly unfolding in American sports consumption that few have noticed, but one that tells us something unexpected about the current moment. In 2024, Apple and Formula 1 announced that 52 million Americans identify as Formula 1 fans. This is a remarkable number—nearly a sixth of the entire U.S. population claims fandom.

Yet when ESPN broadcasts a typical race, about 1.3 million Americans actually watch. Sometimes fewer.

That's a gap of roughly 40 to 1.

To put this in perspective, if the same ratio applied to the National Football League, we'd say there are 1.7 billion American "NFL fans" but only 43 million actually watch games. Or imagine if Starbucks announced it had 300 million American customers, but only 7 million actually bought coffee. The absurdity becomes obvious.

So what exactly is happening? Is Formula 1 on the verge of explosive growth in America, poised to join soccer and basketball as a mainstream sport? Or is it settling into something more modest: a large cultural presence with a much smaller habitual audience—a sort of "cool thing to identify with" that doesn't translate into sustained viewing behavior?

The answer, it turns out, has more to do with how modern identity works than with the sport itself.

## The Two-Tier Reality

To understand this phenomenon, it helps to step back and ask: What does it mean to be a "fan"?

For most of sports history, the answer was simple. A fan was someone who watched the games, knew the players, had favorite teams, and caught the big moments. Identity and behavior were aligned. You were a fan *because* you watched.

But Formula 1's growth in America reveals that the relationship between identity and behavior has fractured. You can now claim authentic fandom while barely watching any races—and apparently, millions of Americans do exactly that.

This splits the American F1 audience into two distinct tiers:

**Tier 1: The Core** consists of roughly 1-1.5 million people who watch most races. They have "view-by-default" behavior. When a Grand Prix is on, they watch it. They recognize Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton. They have opinions about tire strategy and team politics. For them, F1 is a regular cultural practice, a weekend ritual.

**Tier 2: The Affinity** consists of the remaining 50+ million people who identify as F1 fans but rarely watch any races. They know F1 is glamorous. They've maybe watched *Drive to Survive*, the Netflix docuseries. They bought F1 merchandise once. They think Verstappen seems cool. If there's a Las Vegas Grand Prix and everyone's talking about it, they might tune in. But they're not habitual viewers. Their fandom is cultural capital more than behavioral practice.

This two-tier structure has profound implications for understanding F1's actual trajectory in America. And the evidence suggests it's becoming more entrenched, not less.

## The Vegas Effect (And Its Limits)

A natural question arises: If F1 has 52 million fans, why haven't viewership numbers grown more dramatically?

Part of the answer lies in what we might call "the Vegas effect"—the idea that adding a U.S. Grand Prix (Las Vegas, Miami, Austin) would act as a catalyst, attracting casual Americans to F1 in droves. After all, Americans show up for American events. The theory was intuitive: put F1 on American soil, and American audiences will come.

The evidence suggests this theory is only half-right.

When ESPN reported its 2025 U.S. viewership data, an interesting pattern emerged. Yes, the American races performed well: the Las Vegas Grand Prix drew strong audiences. But so did the European races. Monaco (~2.3 million U.S. viewers), and various European championship-deciding moments (~1.3-1.5 million) all drew robust Tier 1 engagement.

The observation: F1's American viewership is not primarily driven by "watching American drivers in American races." It's driven by something else—the intensity of engagement among the core audience, which spans all races regardless of location. The European races perform well *because* the core audience is committed and location-agnostic.

This suggests that adding U.S. races didn't create a "spectacle gateway" that converted millions of Tier 2 affinity fans into habitual viewers. The Tier 2 fans felt the appeal (Vegas is exciting! It's American!), but most didn't develop the sustained viewing behavior that characterizes Tier 1 membership.

In other words: a glamorous U.S. Grand Prix is exciting enough to claim as identity ("I'm an F1 fan!"), but not compelling enough to develop the viewing habit ("I watch all 24 races").

## The Platform Question: What Happens When Apple Takes Over?

This two-tier reality becomes especially important in late 2025, as Formula 1 undergoes a seismic shift. For three decades, F1 was distributed on cable television—first as a niche sport on ESPN, later as highlights and races became more accessible. Millions had easy access: the race was on ESPN, and anyone with cable could watch.

Starting in 2026, F1 becomes exclusive to Apple TV+.

This is a significant distribution change. Unlike linear television (which everyone who has a TV can access), streaming requires an active subscription and intentional sign-up. There's friction. And history offers warnings about friction.

Consider Major League Soccer, which moved select matches to Apple's MLS Season Pass—a paywalled add-on product. When MLS Commissioner Don Garber disclosed recent viewership numbers, he reported approximately 120,000 unique viewers per match via the streaming product. Pre-Apple, MLS games on ESPN averaged around 343,000 viewers. That's a roughly 65% decline in reachable audience.

The lesson: moving a sport from cable to a paywalled streaming product can compress reach materially, especially among casual viewers.

But here's the crucial part: MLS later course-corrected. In 2026, most MLS matches are moving into Apple TV's base subscription package rather than remaining as an add-on product. This is friction reduction—"bundling" rather than requiring yet another payment layer.

Apple has telegraphed similar mitigation for F1. The deal includes free access to all practice sessions and select races within the Apple TV app, plus F1 TV Premium (more comprehensive coverage) as part of Apple TV subscription. This is significantly less friction than the MLS Season Pass model.

So what will happen to F1 viewership post-Apple transition?

The data from other sports suggests a middle outcome. If Apple's mitigation features work well—if practices and key races are genuinely accessible, if the discovery experience is seamless—Tier 1 audiences may remain stable or grow slightly. The core viewers have proven their commitment; they'll find the races on Apple.

But Tier 2 is more vulnerable. The reason millions claim "F1 fandom" while watching almost no races is partly because it's costless and effortless to do so. When you need to have ESPN or find clips online, claiming fandom has no behavioral friction. But making the conscious decision to subscribe to Apple TV+ and actively seek out races is a new commitment threshold. Many Tier 2 fans will likely not cross it.

This isn't speculation—it's the inverse of how streaming services attract audiences. The low-friction distribution model (cable) enabled high identity/low behavior fandom. The higher-friction model (subscription streaming) will likely correlate identity more tightly to behavior.

In other words: Apple's move might actually resolve this paradox by compressing both the fanbase *and* the viewership numbers. Fewer people might claim F1 fandom if it requires active subscription. But the people who remain fans will have higher viewing conversion rates.

## The Institutional Bet (And What It Reveals)

Here's where the story gets interesting. Despite the two-tier structure and the platform transition risk, major institutions are making enormous bets on F1's American future.

Ford Motor Company, the 120-year-old Detroit icon, has announced a long-term technical partnership with Red Bull Powertrains for the 2026 engine era. This isn't a sponsorship—it's a commitment to develop and supply engines, likely costing Ford hundreds of millions of dollars. General Motors is pursuing its own American F1 entry, allegedly investing $500 million or more.

Why would Ford and GM make such large bets if F1 was truly failing to crack the American market?

The answer reveals something subtle about how major corporations evaluate sports investments. They're not betting on mass viewership. They're betting on *tier 1 value.*

The core F1 audience—the roughly 1-1.5 million Americans who watch most or all races—is extraordinarily valuable. These aren't passive, distracted viewers. They're engaged, affluent, demographically desirable consumers who actively consume F1 content across multiple platforms. They buy merchandise at high rates. They engage with F1 news, podcasts, and analysis. They discuss races on social media. They attend Grand Prix events when possible.

This is precisely the audience that OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) partnerships target: high-involvement enthusiasts for whom the F1 brand conveys engineering excellence, innovation, prestige, and aspirational value.

Ford isn't betting that 52 million Americans will buy Ford because they're F1 fans. Ford is betting that the 1-1.5 million core F1 fans—and the millions more globally in the core audience—will view Ford as a cutting-edge, prestigious brand because Ford is *innovating in Formula 1*.

From this perspective, the Tier 1/Tier 2 split isn't a problem. It's the whole story. It's the entire reason Ford is interested.

A massive mass audience that provides viewership metrics for television advertising? That's less valuable to Ford than a smaller audience of ultra-engaged, high-net-worth enthusiasts. Mass audiences don't buy premium vehicles. Enthusiasts do.

## The Precedent of Imported Sports

To understand whether this two-tier model is stable or a transition phase, it helps to look at historical precedent. How have other sports adopted in America managed identity/behavior relationships?

Soccer provides a useful parallel. In the 1980s and 90s, soccer was often dismissed as a sport that "Americans would never care about." Yet by the 2010s, millions of Americans identified as soccer fans. MLS attendance grew. The U.S. National Team developed a following.

Yet American soccer fandom exhibits a similar two-tier structure. Millions of Americans identify as soccer fans or support English Premier League teams. But viewership data reveals that most of these "fans" are occasional viewers. The habitual audience—people who watch most league matches each season—is much smaller than the population claiming fandom.

This two-tier pattern is common for sports that are "imported" into a culture where they weren't indigenous. Soccer, cricket, rugby, and Formula 1 all show this signature: large affinity fandom + smaller habitual core.

Why? Because these sports haven't embedded themselves into childhood developmental pathways. An American kid growing up in 2025 might develop soccer fandom through social media and online culture without ever having played the sport, attended matches, or developed the viewing habits that accompany cultural embeddedness.

The viewing behavior develops through embodied experience (playing, attending, rituals with friends and family). The fandom identity can develop through pure cultural exposure and peer signaling. These are decoupled.

So the question for F1 is: Will the two-tier pattern persist, or will the core audience eventually expand as younger generations who watched *Drive to Survive* develop into habitual viewers?

The honest answer is: We don't know, and it depends on factors beyond F1's control.

## The Timing Paradox

Here's the uncomfortable part of the story, the thing no one wants to acknowledge: The transition to Apple TV happens right as the "easy recruitment" phase is ending.

*Drive to Survive*, the Netflix docuseries that brought millions of casual Americans into F1 fandom, has been losing momentum. Netflix reports that Season 7 (2025) saw first-week viewership decline of about 10% compared to Season 6, and hours watched declined 11%. The same show that once acted as a gateway drug to F1 fandom is declining in cultural penetration.

This is normal for any media property with finite novelty appeal. But it matters for F1's U.S. trajectory. The docuseries was essentially a free onramp to F1 fandom—it required no F1 knowledge, it was entertaining in ways F1 itself isn't always (drama, backstory, emotion), and it could reach viewers who might never encounter a live race.

As *Drive to Survive* loses cultural momentum, the funnel for converting casual observers into F1 fans will narrow.

And this is happening *at the exact moment* that Apple is raising the behavioral friction for watching races. The media property that drove affinity fandom expansion is declining, and the distribution mechanism that enables habitual viewing is becoming less accessible.

These two trends point in the same direction: toward stabilization of the core audience and potential contraction of the affinity tier.

## What This Reveals About American Culture

Underneath the specific story of F1's two-tier American market lurks a larger observation about contemporary American culture and consumption.

We live in an era of "identity cosmopolitanism"—the ability to construct identity through cultural signals without corresponding behavioral commitment. You can be a "F1 fan" without watching races. You can be a "soccer fan" without playing or regularly watching matches. You can be a "philosophy enthusiast" after reading one Aristotle quote on social media.

This isn't shallow, exactly. It reflects real engagement with global culture and real aesthetic appreciation. But it's decoupled from the embodied practices and rituals that historically characterized fandom.

The internet, streaming, and social media have enabled this decoupling. You can consume cultural *symbols* (Monaco! Glamour! Verstappen! Speed!) without consuming cultural *practices* (watching 24 races per season, learning tire strategies, staying up for Singapore). The identity and the behavior have separated.

For sports that are indigenous to American culture—baseball, football, basketball—this decoupling is less pronounced. Kids grow up playing these sports or watching them with family and friends. Identity and behavior develop together through childhood and adolescence. Even casual fans have some embodied connection.

For imported sports, there's no such childhood developmental pathway. Fandom identity can develop purely through digital cultural exposure. The two tiers are a reflection of this structural reality.

## So: What Happens Next?

If you asked F1 and Apple what they expect for 2026 onward, they'd probably paint an optimistic picture: Apple's technology and global reach will expose F1 to new audiences. Exclusive distribution can increase subscription value. The core audience is engaged and growing.

All of this is plausible. But the structural evidence suggests a more modest trajectory.

Most likely scenario: The core American F1 audience remains stable or grows slightly (1-1.5 million habitual viewers, perhaps trending toward 1.8-2 million over 3-4 years as newer docuseries and global marketing reach younger cohorts). The affinity tier consolidates—some drop off as barrier to entry increases, but this isn't a collapse, just a correction. Institutional investments continue because the core audience is valuable, not because of mass-market ambitions.

Less likely but possible: Apple's ecosystem features and content strategy successfully convert a meaningful portion of Tier 2 into Tier 1, pushing habitual viewership toward 2.5-3 million. This would require exceptional execution on discoverability and bundling.

Unlikely but catastrophic: The Apple transition alienates casual viewers faster than expected, the core audience declines more than anticipated, and the investment thesis proves overpriced. This would likely happen if Apple's free sample content is poorly curated or if the subscription mechanics feel unnecessarily friction-filled.

What's least likely: The American F1 market converges toward European-style mass habitual viewership, with 10+ million Americans regularly watching races. The structural conditions simply don't support this without a major exogenous shift (like F1 becoming indigenous to American childhood through youth motorsport development or another major cultural inflection point).

## What This Means

If you're a F1 fan or an investor in Formula 1, this analysis should provoke a specific kind of intellectual honesty: Let go of the "explosive growth" narrative. The data doesn't support it. What the data supports is a more interesting and complex reality.

F1 has achieved something genuinely remarkable in the U.S.: It's become a recognized, desirable, aspirational cultural property. Fifty-two million people claiming fandom is an achievement, even if it doesn't translate directly to viewing behavior.

But claiming F1 fandom and regularly watching F1 races are two different things. The gap between them is the whole story. It's not a problem to be solved. It's a structural feature of how global culture is consumed in the early 21st century.

The Apple transition, institutional investments, and platform strategies all make sense not as bets on mass American conversion, but as bets on deepening engagement with a valuable core audience while maintaining cultural prestige among the broader affinity tier.

This is a different kind of success than mainstream American sports have achieved. It's not "converting America." It's maintaining a genuine subculture of intense enthusiasts plus a broader ring of cultural identification.

Whether that's enough—enough for Apple, enough for Ford and GM, enough for F1's long-term viability—depends on factors beyond sports consumption alone.

But one thing is clear: The 40-to-1 gap between fans and viewers isn't a temporary anomaly. It's the new normal of how Americans relate to global sports culture. And F1 is perhaps the clearest expression of that new relationship yet.
