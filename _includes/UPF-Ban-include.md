## Opening: When “Most of Our Calories” Becomes a Policy Category

If you want a single number that captures how radically the American diet has changed, start here: **ultra-processed foods now supply 55% of the calories Americans eat—and 62% for kids and teens** [1]. That isn’t a niche exposure. It’s the default.

At the same time, the chronic disease burden that public health officials have been warning about for years has become impossible to treat as background noise: **40.3% of U.S. adults are obese; more than 40 million people have diabetes; another 115 million are prediabetic; and heart disease kills about 683,000 Americans each year.** The economic costs attributed to diet-related chronic disease are routinely put in the **trillions**—around **$3.7 trillion annually** in the background document provided for this analysis. However one debates the accounting, the lived reality is visible in every waiting room and school nurse’s office.

The question now being asked in statehouses—and, increasingly, in Washington—is whether the “ultra-processed” idea is more than a provocative label. **Is it the main causal force behind the modern epidemic of chronic disease? And if so, can policies aimed at processing (not just sugar, sodium, or calories) measurably improve health within ten years?**

Until very recently, that question lived mostly in academic journals and book tours. Then the policy machinery started moving. In July 2025, the federal health and agriculture agencies issued a **Request for Information** seeking input on how to define ultra-processed foods for regulatory purposes—the first formal step toward a federal definition, drawing **over 5,100 public comments** [2]. In January 2026, the new **Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2025–2030)** became the first to explicitly advise Americans to avoid “highly processed foods,” elevating processing from a talking point to official guidance. Meanwhile the MAHA Commission’s 2025 strategy report signaled an unusually aggressive agenda: a federal UPF definition, front-of-pack labeling, GRAS reform, and additive restrictions among its priorities.

States have moved even faster. Arizona passed a bill billed as banning ultra-processed foods in public schools; California enacted a law that *defines* ultra-processed foods in statute and sketches a long runway toward restricting them in schools. Texas advanced a warning-label approach for dozens of additives—prompting lawsuits and counter-lawsuits. Across 38 states, more than 140 bills have targeted additives or processing-adjacent features.

This article is built from an analytical review of the evidence behind that surge. **The result:** the evidence supports ultra-processed foods as a major, independent causal contributor to chronic disease risk, but it does not yet justify confidence that they are *the* primary driver of the entire epidemic—and the claim that processing-focused policies will deliver broad, measurable disease reductions within a decade looks plausible in some settings and outcomes, but conditional on design, enforcement, substitution effects, and equity.

What makes this hard—and also worth doing now—is that the evidence is strong enough to act on, yet not neat enough to legislate without careful choices. So the rest of this piece is about those choices: what we know, what we’re assuming, and what a realistic ten-year public-health win would actually look like.

## The Evidence: What “Ultra-Processed” Explains—and What It Doesn’t

### The exposure is enormous—and uneven by design

A causal claim needs an exposure large enough to matter. Ultra-processed foods clear that bar easily. National dietary surveillance has repeatedly found that a majority of U.S. calories come from foods typically classified as ultra-processed, with even higher shares among the young [1]. The August 2025 CDC Data Brief is especially important not because it is dramatic—UPFs were already known to dominate—but because it makes the point official, current, and demographically detailed: age gradients are steep, and the youth share is not a rounding error. It is a foundational fact for any “primary driver” argument: if UPFs are harmful, they are harmful at population scale.

But the same surveillance data that makes UPFs look like a dominant exposure also complicates the story of causation, because it maps tightly onto structural inequality. Ultra-processed products win on price, shelf life, and convenience; they are overrepresented in the retail environments that low-income households encounter most often, including many SNAP-eligible shopping patterns. When time is scarce and kitchens are small, “minimally processed cooking” is not merely a preference—it’s a resource-intensive practice.

That’s not an abstract point. Studies of household purchasing patterns show clear disparities in the proportion of ultra-processed foods bought, patterned by income and race/ethnicity, consistent with what the background document emphasizes: Black and Hispanic communities often face higher burdens of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular mortality, in food environments saturated with cheap, durable, ready-to-eat products. The food system’s convenience architecture—what’s fast, what’s marketed, what’s available at the corner store—leans heavily toward the ultra-processed.

This matters for the proposition in two opposite ways. On one hand, it strengthens the case for urgency: if most children are growing up on a diet in which ultra-processed foods are the majority of calories, then the long arc of chronic disease is being set early. On the other hand, it forces an uncomfortable causal alternative: UPF intake might be partly a marker for deeper drivers—poverty, stress, housing instability, neighborhood retail design—rather than an independent cause.

In practice, the evidence points toward a layered model rather than a winner-take-all explanation. Structural inequality shapes exposure. The remaining question is whether UPFs then exert additional harm beyond what those structural forces already predict. That takes us from “how much people eat” to “what these foods do.”

### What feeding trials can (and can’t) tell us about appetite and weight

If you could design a simple, persuasive test of whether ultra-processed foods push people toward weight gain, you might do something like this: bring people into a controlled setting, feed them diets matched for calories, sugar, fat, and other obvious nutrients, but different in processing level, and let them eat as much as they want. Then see what happens.

Versions of that experiment have been conducted, and they are a major reason the UPF debate has shifted from culture-war rhetoric to something closer to testable biology. In the most widely discussed trial, participants consumed more calories and gained weight during the ultra-processed diet phase than during the minimally processed phase over a short period (two weeks) [Hall et al., 2019; summarized in NIH materials]. Other randomized crossover work has reported weight differences favoring minimally processed diets over longer windows (weeks) [e.g., 2025 randomized crossover trial in *Nature Medicine*].

These studies are powerful because they cut through a common objection: “People who eat a lot of ultra-processed food are different kinds of people.” Randomization makes the “different kinds of people” problem smaller. When the same person eats differently under two diet conditions, the signal is harder to wave away as pure lifestyle confounding.

But the feeding-trial story is not a clean victory lap for the proposition, for three reasons that matter directly for policy.

First, **duration and realism**. Two weeks—or even eight weeks—doesn’t prove that the effect persists for years in free-living conditions. People eat differently when they’re busy, stressed, and exposed to marketing; they also compensate in ways a short trial might not capture. Critics have argued that short inpatient trials are especially vulnerable to over-interpretation when we leap from “extra intake this week” to “heart disease rates a decade later.” That critique has become more pointed, not less, as prominent scientists have publicly challenged how much can be inferred from brief designs [e.g., critiques in *Cell Metabolism* and *Nature Medicine*].

Second, **the “processing” variable is entangled with other features people can feel in their mouths**. Ultra-processed foods tend to be softer, easier to chew, and faster to eat. One small crossover study in Japan found not only higher intake and short-term weight gain on ultra-processed foods, but changes in chewing frequency—suggesting a mechanical pathway from texture to satiety [Hamano et al., 2024]. That is still “processing” in a meaningful sense, but it’s not processing as an abstract moral category; it’s processing as engineering: food that is easier to consume rapidly, before the body’s satiety signals catch up.

Third, **energy density and palatability can masquerade as processing**. Some skeptical analyses have argued that the crucial driver in certain trials is energy density—calories per gram—rather than processing per se. If so, processing-level regulation that misses energy density could disappoint, while nutrient- or formulation-focused regulation might outperform it. This is one of the live fault lines in the debate: whether “ultra-processed” is a causal category or a convenient bundle of more proximate drivers.

What remains after those caveats is still consequential: controlled feeding studies make it difficult to argue that ultra-processed diets are harmless simply because nutrition labels can be made to match. Something about the way many ultra-processed foods are built—texture, speed of eating, reward cues, variety, convenience—can shift intake in the direction that makes weight gain easier. For a country where obesity is the most visible chronic-disease accelerator, that is not a small point. But it is not, by itself, proof that UPFs are *the* primary driver of all chronic disease, nor that a processing-based law will reliably recreate the trial’s conditions in everyday life.

### The long-view epidemiology: consistent signals, but not a single story

Feeding trials are the microscope. Prospective cohort studies are the wide-angle lens: large populations followed for years, comparing people who consume more UPFs to those who consume less, while statistically adjusting for obvious confounders.

Across many cohorts and multiple outcomes—cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, all-cause mortality, some cancers—higher ultra-processed intake is repeatedly associated with higher risk. Meta-analyses pooling many cohorts have found dose–response patterns in which higher UPF consumption tracks with higher mortality and higher incident diabetes risk. A 2025 dose–response meta-analysis including roughly 1.15 million participants, for example, reported a meaningful association between higher UPF intake and all-cause mortality, with risk rising as UPF share increases [Liang et al., 2025]. Other pooled studies report elevated type 2 diabetes risk at higher UPF intake levels [Delpino et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2025]. Individual cohorts add texture: in the Whitehall II cohort, long-term high UPF intake trajectories were associated with higher cardiovascular risk after extensive adjustment [Wang et al., 2025]. In the UK Biobank, analyses suggest processing may matter even when foods are plant-sourced—an important clue that the “it’s just red meat and sugar” explanation is incomplete [Rauber et al., 2024].

This is the part of the evidence base that makes the “UPFs are central” argument hard to dismiss. If the association were weak, inconsistent, and limited to one country or one outcome, the policy momentum would look like a fad. Instead, a pattern keeps appearing across settings.

And yet, cohort evidence is also where “primary causal driver” claims most often go to die—not because cohorts are useless, but because they are honest about human complexity. Three tensions show up again and again.

**Confounding by life circumstances** is the first. Even excellent cohorts cannot perfectly measure the full mix of constraints and habits that lead people toward ultra-processed diets: irregular work schedules, childcare load, neighborhood retail, stress, sleep, smoking history, healthcare access. UPF intake can sit downstream of those forces. Statistically adjusting for “income” or “education” is not the same as capturing time poverty or neighborhood food reality.

**Diet quality overlap** is the second. Some studies find that when overall diet quality is accounted for, the association between UPF intake and cardiometabolic risk shrinks dramatically or disappears—suggesting that, in at least some populations, UPFs may act largely by displacing fiber-rich, minimally processed foods and increasing calories, sugar, and sodium. A cross-sectional study in British police employees reported full mediation by diet quality—an extreme case, but a useful warning label: sometimes “UPF” may be a shadow cast by diet composition rather than an independent causal light source.

**Heterogeneity and counterexamples** are the third. Not every cohort finds the same result. The Isfahan Cohort Study, for example, reported no significant association between UPF consumption and incident cardiovascular events or cardiovascular mortality over long follow-up [Kermani-Alghoraishi et al., 2024]. That kind of counterexample can mean several things: measurement differences in how UPFs are defined, different ranges of UPF exposure, different background diets, or genuine effect modification by context. But the existence of credible null findings makes a simple “UPFs always drive disease everywhere” claim untenable.

So what can we responsibly say from the epidemiology? The evidence supports the idea that higher UPF consumption is *often* a meaningful risk marker and *sometimes* plausibly causal beyond nutrients, particularly when the associations persist after adjusting for many aspects of diet quality and lifestyle. It also supports the idea that calories and nutrients remain major pathways linking UPFs to harm, which complicates the proposition’s insistence on “processing level (not just nutrients).” In many real diets, processing and nutrients are fused; disentangling them is scientifically informative but politically tricky.

### The mechanisms are plausible—and messy in exactly the way regulation hates

If the cohort data raises the “correlation versus causation” question, mechanistic research asks a different one: what about ultra-processed foods could plausibly cause harm, beyond their typical nutrient profile?

Here the evidence is less definitive than in, say, tobacco science, but it is no longer hand-waving. Researchers have described multiple pathways by which processing-linked features could matter:

- **Additives and gut biology.** Certain emulsifiers—common in industrial formulations—have induced inflammation and metabolic changes in animal models, apparently mediated by the microbiome [Chassaing et al., 2015]. Translational work has shown direct impacts of emulsifiers on human-derived gut microbial communities ex vivo, and a short human controlled-feeding study of carboxymethylcellulose found shifts in microbiome/metabolomic markers in ways that concern researchers, even over 11 days [Chassaing et al., 2022]. None of this proves population-scale disease causation, but it strengthens the plausibility that “processing” sometimes corresponds to biologically active exposures.

- **Packaging-derived chemicals.** Reviews have highlighted how food packaging can leach endocrine-disrupting compounds, raising the possibility that part of the UPF signal is not the food alone but the industrial ecosystem surrounding it—wrappers, linings, plastics [Menegassi & Vinciguerra, 2025].

- **Food structure and satiety.** Processing changes the physical matrix of food. When structure is broken down—through extrusion, pulverization, reconstitution—digestion and absorption can shift. Some of the most policy-relevant mechanisms are not exotic toxicology but simple kinetics: how quickly calories can be consumed and how rapidly blood sugar rises, how long satiety lasts, whether chewing and gastric stretch cues are triggered.

What’s notable is that this mechanistic pluralism cuts both ways. It strengthens the general case that “processing can matter,” while weakening the idea that a single processing definition will cleanly target the harm. One ultra-processed product might be problematic because it is energy-dense and easy to overeat; another because of additive combinations; another because it delivers liquid calories paired with aggressive marketing; another because it displaces a culturally stable meal pattern. From a regulatory standpoint, a heterogeneous category is hard to write into law without creating loopholes—or without sweeping in foods that may be helpful in certain contexts.

That definitional problem is not academic nitpicking. Studies of the most widely used processing classification system (NOVA) have found only moderate—or sometimes poor—agreement between experts assigning foods to categories, especially for mixed dishes and ambiguous products. A 2026 comparison of classification frameworks in NHANES reported low-to-moderate agreement between coders using NOVA (κ around 0.46), which is not what you want when trying to regulate a category [Du et al., 2026]. Other work has reported similarly low inter-rater reliability in expert panels.

This is the point where the proposition’s first clause (“UPFs are the primary causal driver”) meets the second (“policies targeting processing level will reduce disease”). Even if UPFs are causally important, policy depends on the ability to define and monitor the target. A category that scientists debate and lawyers can game is a category that industries can reformulate around. That doesn’t mean processing-based policy is doomed. It means the regulatory object must mature from a concept into an operational standard: something measurable enough to enforce and explainable enough to gain legitimacy.

That’s precisely why the federal Request for Information in 2025 matters [2]. A federal definition process is, in effect, an attempt to convert a research construct into a regulatory instrument—turning “ultra-processed” from a contested label into a governable exposure.

### The policy record: strong on shifting purchases, thinner on proving disease declines in ten years

The proposition’s second half is the harder promise: not just that UPFs matter, but that policy targeting processing level will measurably reduce disease burden within a decade.

Here, the most robust real-world evidence comes from policies that target *product attributes* closely correlated with ultra-processing—especially warning labels, marketing restrictions, and school sales rules—even when they are not explicitly “processing-level” laws. Chile is the best-known example. Its front-of-package warning labels and marketing restrictions were associated with substantial reductions in purchases of calories and nutrients of concern, and large declines in children’s exposure to unhealthy food advertising on television [Taillie et al., 2021; Taillie et al., 2024]. Reformulation followed as companies tried to avoid label thresholds.

Chile’s lesson is not “one weird trick” that the U.S. can copy wholesale. It is more specific: when governments change default incentives—what can be marketed to kids, what requires a warning symbol, what can be sold in schools—industry and households do respond at scale. That is a direct rebuttal to fatalism. It is also a warning: the biggest near-term measurable impacts tend to be **intermediate outcomes**—purchases, exposure to ads, nutrient composition—rather than immediate collapses in diabetes incidence.

Can intermediate outcomes translate to measurable disease burden within ten years? Sometimes, yes. Modelling studies of sugar-sweetened beverage taxes in other countries project meaningful case reductions within a decade, precisely because some risk factors respond quickly. The WHO has also argued that certain “quick buy” policies can yield measurable noncommunicable disease improvements within about five years—though those examples are not always processing-based, and their success depends heavily on implementation.

The U.S. now sits at a different starting line: fragmented authority, intense litigation, and deep reliance on school meals and SNAP as nutrition infrastructure. The 2025–2026 surge in state bills—additive warnings, school restrictions, labeling proposals—will function as a natural experiment, but not a clean one. States will choose different definitions; industry will respond in different ways; baseline diets and healthcare access differ widely.

A ten-year evaluation horizon is realistic for some endpoints and unrealistic for others. You could reasonably measure, within a decade:

- changes in UPF purchasing and consumption shares,
- childhood BMI trajectories and obesity incidence,
- blood pressure and lipid risk-factor shifts in targeted populations,
- diabetes incidence trends in subgroups where baseline risk is high and interventions are strong.

It is less realistic to promise uniform, national declines in heart-disease mortality attributable mainly to processing rules, because those outcomes are influenced by healthcare, smoking, medications, and long time lags.

This is where the policy claim becomes contingent. The evidence supports the possibility of meaningful health gains, but it also supports a more limited prediction: the gains will be largest where policy can tightly control the food environment—schools, government procurement, institutional settings—and where complementary supports address affordability and access.

## Implications: What a “Processing Policy” Would Need to Be to Work

The current American debate often treats “ultra-processed foods” as if it were a single lever: pull it, and chronic disease rates fall. The evidence points toward a more practical framing: processing-based policy can work, but only if it is built like other successful public-health policies—specific enough to enforce, broad enough to matter, and designed for the environments where people actually eat.

**First: schools are the highest-leverage, lowest-ambiguity starting point.** Children consume a majority-UPF diet [1], and school food environments are one of the few places policy can shape defaults without pretending to police private kitchens. States like Arizona and California, whatever the eventual legal and logistical details, are implicitly betting on a basic logic: if you reduce the routine exposure of children to the most industrial formulations—especially the ones engineered to be easy to overconsume—you may shift weight trajectories early enough to matter.

But to get real health gains rather than symbolic victories, school policy has to be paired with *procurement realism*. Minimally processed food is often more perishable and labor-intensive. If districts are asked to eliminate a swath of shelf-stable products without receiving funding for kitchens, staff, and supply chains, the predictable result is substitution—sometimes into equally calorie-dense options that evade the definition, sometimes into lower-quality meals that kids throw away. A processing-based restriction that increases waste and reduces participation can backfire.

**Second: SNAP is the equity test, and it will make or break legitimacy.** If processing-level regulation increases costs or reduces convenience for low-income households without expanding access to affordable, appealing alternatives, it risks functioning as moral regulation aimed at people with the least room to maneuver. The evidence base already shows UPF exposure concentrated where time poverty and constrained retail dominate. A serious processing agenda therefore can’t be only punitive. It needs positive scaffolding: subsidies for minimally processed staples, investment in retail access, and possibly incentives for reformulation that preserve affordability while reducing the features most plausibly linked to harm.

**Third: the definitional fight is not a distraction; it is the policy.** The evidence suggests that “ultra-processed” is a meaningful risk cluster, but also that today’s classification systems are noisy enough to invite legal challenge and strategic reformulation. The federal effort to define UPFs [2] is not just bureaucratic housekeeping. It is the attempt to answer, in enforceable language, what we mean by “processing level.”

A workable definition likely needs to move away from a purely philosophical description (“industrial formulations”) toward a hybrid that regulators can audit: markers such as certain additive classes, industrial ingredient fractions, physical processing methods, and perhaps objective indicators like ingredient complexity. The point is not to pretend that ingredient count is destiny; it’s to make the regulatory target legible.

**Fourth: the best ten-year metrics may not be disease endpoints at all—at least at first.** If policymakers promise large, near-term drops in heart disease mortality from processing policy, they set themselves up for an avoidable credibility collapse. The more realistic path is to treat the first decade like a staged trial in the real world, with pre-registered evaluation metrics: UPF calorie share, marketing exposure, school meal composition, purchasing data, and intermediate health indicators like childhood obesity incidence and diabetes biomarkers in high-risk groups. Chile’s experience shows that purchase shifts are measurable and meaningful. The U.S. can learn from that without insisting that every policy must “prove itself” only through mortality statistics.

**Fifth: the rise of GLP-1 drugs changes the politics and the counterfactual.** Recent market signals—declines in snack sales attributed partly to GLP-1 use and economic pressure—suggest that dietary patterns can shift for reasons unrelated to processing policy. That matters for evaluation: if obesity rates change, attribution will be contested. It also matters ethically: a future in which medications suppress appetite while the food environment remains engineered for overconsumption may reduce some disease burden while leaving the underlying exposure intact, with costs and side effects distributed unevenly. Processing policy, at its best, aims to change the environment so that medication is an option, not the default defense.

Finally, the strongest implication for the proposition itself is a design lesson: **policies that target processing level are most likely to deliver measurable gains within a decade when they operate where defaults are controllable (schools, procurement, marketing to children) and when they are paired with affordability and access measures.** Processing-only policy, treated as a single nationwide ban or label without scaffolding, is less likely to meet the proposition’s timeline.

## Closing: The Next Decade Will Not Settle the Debate—It Will Sort the Claims

Humans didn’t evolve on “ultra-processed” diets; the American food supply of the last half-century is, in a real sense, a population-scale experiment. The proposition that UPFs are the primary causal driver of chronic disease is trying to name the experiment’s dominant variable. The evidence supports the idea that the variable matters—a lot—but it also suggests the experiment has multiple moving parts: inequality shaping exposure, industrial formulation shaping appetite, nutrients mediating harm, and policy shaping what is cheap, easy, and normal.

The most honest forecast is not that we will soon “prove” a single cause. It’s that the U.S. is entering a period where definitions will be written, lawsuits will test them, and state-by-state policies will create divergent food environments. Those differences—especially in institutions like schools—will generate clearer evidence than we have now, because they will change real exposure at scale.

Whether the disease burden measurably declines within ten years will depend less on the elegance of our arguments than on the craft of implementation: how precisely we define the target, how we prevent easy substitution, and whether we make healthier defaults feasible for households living under time and money constraints. The question is no longer whether ultra-processed foods are “bad.” The question is whether America can build a public-health policy that recognizes what the evidence actually says—strong enough to matter, careful enough to be fair, and concrete enough to be enforceable.
