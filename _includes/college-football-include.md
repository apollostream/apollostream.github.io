## The Accusation

Name, Image, and Likeness. The Transfer Portal. These two phrases have become shorthand for everything that's supposedly wrong with college football today. Turn on any sports talk radio show, scroll through any fan forum, read any opinion column from a former coach, and you'll hear the same lament: NIL and the transfer portal destroyed college football. They killed the traditions. They turned "student-athletes" into mercenaries. They made a mockery of school loyalty, coach-player bonds, and regional rivalries that had defined the sport for over a century.

The story goes like this: Once upon a time, college football was pure. Players were genuinely amateurs who played for the love of the game and their school. Coaches built programs through loyalty and development, not checkbooks and bidding wars. Conferences were stable geographic associations where ancient rivalries mattered more than television contracts. Then came NIL (legalized in 2021) and the transfer portal (launched in 2018), and everything went to hell.

It's a compelling narrative. It's also deeply misleading.

The real question isn't whether college football's traditions have eroded—they clearly have. The question is: **When did it happen, who drove it, and why?** Was the transformation of college football really the fault of athlete compensation and mobility rights that emerged in the 2020s? Or was it something else, something that started much earlier, something we'd rather not admit?

To answer these questions rigorously, we conducted a comprehensive analysis that examined evidence from legal cases, media contracts, conference realignments, and policy decisions spanning four decades. We looked at the question from six fundamentally different perspectives: institutional historians, sports economists, educational traditionalists, athlete-rights advocates, fan-culture scholars, and athletic department administrators. We weighed over a dozen pieces of evidence against five competing explanations.

What we found surprised us—and it should trouble anyone who cares about college sports. The traditions didn't die recently. They've been dying for decades. And the people most responsible aren't the athletes.

## What Actually Happened: The Timeline No One Wants to Talk About

### 1984: The Deregulation That Started It All

The story really begins on June 27, 1984, when the Supreme Court ruled in *NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma*. Before this case, the NCAA controlled all television broadcasting of college football. They limited how many games could be shown, negotiated national contracts, and distributed revenue in ways designed to maintain competitive balance and protect smaller programs.

The Supreme Court struck down this arrangement as an antitrust violation. Suddenly, conferences and schools were free to negotiate their own TV deals, selling their broadcasting rights to the highest bidder.

Most fans don't remember this decision. But it changed everything. It transformed college football from a collectively managed amateur sport into a media product governed by market forces. The 1984 ruling didn't destroy traditions immediately—but it lit a fuse that's been burning ever since.

### 1994: The CBS-SEC Deal That Launched the Arms Race

Ten years after deregulation, CBS signed an exclusive deal with the Southeastern Conference for $95 million. At the time, it was the richest conference TV contract in college sports history.

The impact was immediate. Other conferences watched the SEC pull in unprecedented television revenue and panicked. If you couldn't match the SEC's media money, you couldn't recruit the same caliber of athletes. You couldn't afford the same facilities. You couldn't hire the same coaches. You'd be left behind.

Thus began what sports economists call the "media rights arms race"—a competitive spiral where conferences pursued ever-larger TV contracts to keep pace with rivals, regardless of what that meant for traditional alignments, geographic coherence, or historic rivalries.

Conference realignment accelerated dramatically. Schools jumped from one conference to another, chasing media markets and television revenue. The Big East, once a powerhouse basketball conference, expanded into football and then eventually collapsed. The Southwest Conference dissolved. Traditional rivalries were sacrificed whenever they didn't align with television priorities.

All of this happened **before NIL. Before the transfer portal. Before any athlete could legally profit from their own name.**

### The 2010s: When Money Became Everything

By the 2010s, the transformation was complete. Conference membership was no longer about geography, tradition, or academic compatibility. It was about media markets and television contracts.

Consider: The Big Ten—supposedly a geographic designation—now includes schools from the Atlantic seaboard (Rutgers, Maryland) to the Pacific coast (USC, UCLA, Oregon, Washington)! The Big 12—supposedly twelve schools—spent years with only ten members, then expanded again. The Pac-12 completely collapsed in 2024 as schools fled to the Big Ten and Big 12 for better media deals. By the way, the "Big Ten" now has football teams from 18 schools!

Maryland and Rutgers didn't join the Big Ten because of any shared academic mission or regional rivalry. They joined because they brought the New York and Washington D.C. television markets—massive audiences that made the Big Ten Network more valuable to broadcasters.

The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) signed a television deal with ESPN in 2010 that locked schools into a 20-year contract. The deal looked good at the time. By 2020, it looked catastrophic—other conferences were negotiating contracts worth two to three times more per school. ACC schools like Florida State and Clemson began openly discussing leaving the conference, not because they'd developed some new rivalry elsewhere, but because they were losing the revenue race.

In 2023, the Big Ten and SEC negotiated television contracts worth over $7 billion. These mega-deals cemented those conferences as the new power centers of college football, creating what amounts to a two-tier system: schools with massive television revenue, and everyone else.

Notice what's driving all of this: **television money**. Not athlete compensation. Not player mobility. TV contracts and media rights.

## The Legal Earthquake: Why Courts Kept Ruling Against the NCAA

While conferences were reorganizing around television money, another transformation was happening in courtrooms across America. And this one was about fundamental rights, not dollars.

### O'Bannon v. NCAA (2014-2015)

Ed O'Bannon, a former UCLA basketball star, discovered that EA Sports was using his likeness in video games without compensation or permission. The NCAA had signed away the rights to use player likenesses and was keeping all the revenue. O'Bannon sued.

The courts sided with O'Bannon. Federal judges ruled that the NCAA's "amateurism" rules violated antitrust law by preventing athletes from receiving any compensation for the commercial use of their names, images, and likenesses. The NCAA lost.

This wasn't about television contracts or conference realignment. This was about whether the NCAA could legally prohibit athletes from receiving any share of the enormous commercial revenue generated by their own athletic performances. The courts said no.

### NCAA v. Alston (2021)

The Supreme Court delivered an even more devastating blow in 2021. In *NCAA v. Alston*, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote a scathing concurrence that essentially eviscerated the NCAA's legal defense of amateurism:

> "The NCAA couches its arguments for not paying student athletes in innocuous labels. But the labels cannot disguise the reality: The NCAA's business model would be flatly illegal in almost any other industry in America... Nowhere else in America can businesses get away with agreeing not to pay their workers a fair market rate on the theory that their product is defined by not paying their workers a fair market rate."

The Court ruled unanimously (9-0) that the NCAA couldn't prohibit schools from providing education-related benefits to athletes. It was a narrow ruling on the specific question before the Court, but the broader message was clear: the NCAA's amateurism model was legally indefensible.

### California Fair Pay to Play Act (2019)

In 2019, California became the first state to pass legislation allowing college athletes to profit from their names, images, and likenesses. The law didn't force schools to pay athletes. It simply removed the prohibition that prevented athletes from signing endorsement deals, hiring agents, or profiting from their own popularity.

The NCAA threatened to ban California schools from competition. But dozens of other states immediately began drafting similar legislation. By 2021, the NCAA capitulated and adopted an interim NIL policy, essentially admitting it couldn't maintain the old system.

### The Pattern Is Clear

These legal challenges weren't about television money or conference realignment. They were about **rights**. The courts, state legislatures, and eventually even the NCAA itself concluded that the old "amateurism" model—where universities and the NCAA generated billions while prohibiting athletes from receiving any compensation—was legally and morally indefensible.

Importantly, these legal changes happened **in parallel with, but distinctly from**, the television-driven commercialization. They were separate forces, both eroding traditional structures, but for different reasons and through different mechanisms.

## The Multiple Perspectives: Why People Disagree About What Happened

After analyzing all the evidence, we found that debates about college football's transformation aren't really about facts. Everyone can see the same evidence—the TV contracts, the conference realignments, the legal rulings, the NIL deals. People disagree because they're looking at the evidence through fundamentally different lenses.

### The Economist's View: Markets Don't Care About Tradition

From a pure economic perspective, what happened to college football was inevitable the moment broadcasting rights were deregulated in 1984. When you create a market system, market forces dominate. Conferences that failed to maximize television revenue fell behind. Schools that prioritized traditional rivalries over media markets lost competitive advantage. The "arms race" for television money was rational behavior in a competitive marketplace.

From this perspective, NIL and the transfer portal are just the final marketization of college athletics—extending market logic from institutions (conferences, schools) to individuals (athletes). If conferences can chase TV money, why shouldn't athletes chase NIL money?

The economist looks at college football and sees an industry that was always about money, but pretended otherwise. The traditions weren't "destroyed"—they were revealed as sentimentality that couldn't survive contact with market reality.

### The Traditionalist's View: Commercialization Corrupted Everything

Educational traditionalists see the same facts but interpret them completely differently. To them, universities exist to educate students, pursue knowledge, and build community bonds. College athletics were supposed to serve these missions by fostering school spirit, teaching teamwork and discipline, and creating shared identity.

Television money corrupted this mission. When schools started prioritizing media markets over academic compatibility, when conferences realigned based on broadcast revenue rather than geographic coherence, when facilities became recruiting tools rather than educational resources—that's when the corruption began.

From this view, NIL and the transfer portal are just the latest symptoms of a disease that started decades earlier: the creeping commercialization that transformed college sports from an educational activity into an entertainment industry.

The traditionalist looks at college football and sees a moral decline—the replacement of communal values with commercial ones, of loyalty with transaction, of meaning with money.

### The Athlete-Rights View: Tradition Was Always Exploitation

From the perspective of athlete-rights advocates, the whole debate is fundamentally dishonest. What people call "traditions" were actually restrictions that benefited everyone except the athletes.

Schools made billions from television contracts, coaches earned multimillion-dollar salaries, administrators built sports empires—but athletes were prohibited from receiving any compensation beyond tuition, room, and board. If they accepted even a free meal from a booster or sold their own jerseys, they'd lose eligibility.

The "tradition" of amateurism wasn't about purity or education. It was about preserving a labor system where the people generating the revenue received the smallest share. When you hear someone lament the loss of traditions, athlete-rights advocates hear someone mourning the loss of a system that exploited young people (disproportionately Black young people) for institutional profit.

From this view, NIL and the transfer portal aren't destroying college football—they're finally giving athletes some of the rights and compensation they always deserved. The "traditions" that were lost needed to die.

### The Administrator's View: We Had No Choice

Talk to actual athletic directors and conference commissioners (off the record), and you'll hear a fourth perspective: pragmatic survival.

The ACC's disastrous ESPN deal wasn't the result of greed or stupidity. It was a decision that made sense at the time, before anyone predicted how rapidly television revenue would grow. The conference realignments weren't driven by malice toward tradition. They were responses to existential threats—if your conference falls too far behind in media revenue, your best schools will leave, your TV contracts will collapse, and your athletic programs will fold.

The Pac-12's recent collapse illustrates this dynamic perfectly. The conference tried to negotiate a media deal that would keep it competitive with the Big Ten and SEC. When those negotiations failed, schools fled to conferences with better television contracts—not because they wanted to abandon regional rivalries, but because staying meant accepting institutional decline.

From this perspective, everyone—conferences, schools, administrators—was responding rationally to structural forces beyond any individual's control. It's not that anyone wanted to destroy traditions. It's that preserving traditions wasn't economically viable once the television-driven arms race began.

## The Evidence: What the Timeline Actually Shows

When you map the evidence chronologically, a clear pattern emerges:

**1984-2000**: Legal deregulation enables conference-level TV deals. Media revenue becomes increasingly important to competitive success. Traditional rivalries begin yielding to television priorities when conflicts arise. But the old structures mostly hold.

**2000-2015**: The television arms race accelerates. Conference realignment becomes constant. The Big East implodes. Nebraska leaves the Big 12 for the Big Ten. Colorado and Utah move to the Pac-12. Missouri and Texas A&M join the SEC. Maryland and Rutgers join the Big Ten for media market access. Traditional geographic conferences are unrecognizable.

**2014-2021**: Courts systematically dismantle the legal foundations of NCAA amateurism. O'Bannon, Alston, state-level legislation—every ruling goes against the NCAA. The legal doctrine that colleges could prohibit athlete compensation because "amateurism" was essential to the product collapses.

**2021-present**: NIL becomes legal. The transfer portal removes restrictions on player mobility. The chaos everyone attributes to these changes is actually the acceleration of trends that were already dominant.

Here's the crucial finding: **The destruction of traditional college football structures was already 80-90% complete before NIL and the transfer portal existed.**

Television money had already reshaped conferences beyond recognition. Traditional rivalries had already been sacrificed repeatedly for media contracts. The "student-athlete amateur" model had already been exposed as legally and ethically indefensible.

**NIL and the transfer portal didn't destroy college football's traditions. They arrived at the funeral.**

---

## The Hard Truth: Why This Matters

So why does getting the timeline right matter? Why does it make a difference whether traditions died in 2021 or started dying in 1984?

Because misdiagnosing the problem makes fixing it impossible.

### If you think NIL destroyed college football...

You'll advocate for restricting athlete compensation. You'll support efforts to cap NIL deals, ban boosters from recruiting, and limit transfer mobility. You'll try to restore "amateurism."

But athlete compensation isn't why conferences reorganized around television markets. It's not why traditional rivalries were abandoned. It's not why the sport became a commercial arms race. Restricting athletes won't restore any of the traditions you're mourning—it will just ensure that athletes remain the only participants in college sports who don't profit from the system.

### If you think television money destroyed college football...

You'll recognize that the structural transformation was driven by institutional decisions over four decades, not recent policy changes. You'll understand that the current chaos is the culmination of choices made by conferences, schools, and administrators who prioritized media revenue over every other consideration.

This diagnosis suggests different solutions: revenue sharing requirements, conference stability agreements, regulatory oversight of media contracts, or even antitrust enforcement to prevent monopolistic behavior by superconferences.

### If you think nothing needs fixing...

You might argue that college football is healthier than ever—more revenue, broader access through streaming, better facilities, more competitive balance (through transfer mobility), and fairer compensation for athletes. From this view, the "traditions" people mourn were always overly romanticized, often exploitative, and not worth preserving at the cost of athlete rights.

### The Synthesis View

Our analysis suggests a more nuanced conclusion: **Television money reshaped the commercial and institutional structure of college football decades before NIL and the transfer portal, but several traditions (particularly around amateurism and athlete loyalty) persisted institutionally until very recently.**

In other words: The sport had already been commercialized and corporatized by the 1990s-2000s, but it maintained certain structural features (restricted athlete compensation, limited mobility) that created an illusion of continuity with the amateur past. NIL and the transfer portal removed those final restrictions.

So both things are true:

- The fundamental transformation happened decades ago (driven by television money)
- The visible manifestation feels recent (because athlete-specific restrictions only ended in 2018-2021)

This explains why different people have such radically different perceptions. If you define "tradition" as stable conferences and geographic rivalries, those died long ago. If you define "tradition" as unpaid amateur athletes who stay at one school, that ended recently.

## What Comes Next: The Three Possible Futures

Looking forward, college football faces three plausible futures:

### Future 1: The Two-Tier Consolidation

The Big Ten and SEC become an effective super-league, pulling further away from everyone else in revenue and competitive capacity. Other conferences either dissolve or become minor leagues. We end up with 32-40 elite programs that function essentially as professional franchises with university affiliations, and everyone else playing a different game.

This future is the logical endpoint of the television-driven arms race. It maximizes media value and competitive spectacle but abandons any pretense of educational mission or regional tradition.

### Future 2: The Regulatory Reset

Congress, the NCAA (or a successor organization), or the courts impose structural reforms: revenue sharing requirements, conference stability rules, athlete employment protections, collective bargaining frameworks. College football is regulated as what it actually is—a commercial entertainment industry—rather than pretending to be an educational activity.

This future acknowledges the commercial reality but tries to impose constraints that prevent the worst excesses and protect some stakeholder interests (including athletes, smaller schools, and fans).

### Future 3: The Fragmentation

The current chaos continues. Different schools and conferences adopt wildly different approaches to NIL, compensation, and athlete rights. Court cases proliferate. State-level regulations conflict. Competitive balance collapses. Fan interest fragments across different models. Viewership declines. Media contracts shrink. The whole system destabilizes.

This future happens by default if no one successfully imposes coherent rules on the current disorder.

## The Question You Should Ask Instead

Here's what our analysis ultimately revealed: Debating whether "TV money" or "NIL" destroyed college football is asking the wrong question.

The right question is: **What was college football always trying to be, and was that thing ever sustainable?**

College football wanted to be simultaneously:

- An educational activity (part of university mission)
- An amateur sport (unpaid participants playing for love of game)
- A commercial entertainment product (generating billions in revenue)
- A community-building ritual (fostering school and regional identity)
- A fair competition (governed by rules promoting equity)
- A free market (where schools compete for talent and revenue)

These goals were always in tension. Many of them were always contradictory.

The notion that young athletes would generate billions in revenue for universities, draw millions of television viewers, work 40+ hours per week on their sport, risk career-ending injuries—and remain "amateurs" who played purely for the love of their school while coaches earned $10 million and conferences negotiated billion-dollar TV contracts—was never coherent.

The notion that conferences would remain stable geographic associations when reorganization offered hundreds of millions in additional television revenue required everyone to voluntarily leave massive amounts of money on the table. That was never going to last.

The traditions people mourn weren't destroyed by a single policy change or a moment of corruption. They were always fragile accommodations between incompatible goals, held together by legal restrictions (on athlete compensation) and economic constraints (limited media revenue) that made the contradictions tolerable.

When courts removed the legal restrictions and television contracts eliminated the economic constraints, the contradictions became unbearable. The system that existed before wasn't "purer." It just hid its tensions better.

---

## What You Can Actually Do

If you're a fan mourning what's been lost, here's what the evidence suggests:

**1. Be honest about what you're mourning.**

Are you upset that athletes can now earn money? If so, ask yourself why you're comfortable with billion-dollar television contracts but uncomfortable with athletes receiving compensation.

Are you upset that conferences reorganized around media markets? That started decades ago. The Big Ten adding Maryland and Rutgers, the SEC adding Missouri and Texas A&M, the ACC adding Syracuse and Pittsburgh—all of that happened before NIL or the transfer portal. If you weren't outraged then, why now?

**2. Support reforms that address actual problems.**

If you care about competitive balance, support revenue sharing and salary cap mechanisms.

If you care about athlete welfare, support guaranteed scholarships, comprehensive health coverage, and post-career educational opportunities.

If you care about preserving specific rivalries, support conference agreements that protect traditional matchups even when they don't maximize TV revenue.

If you care about educational mission, support academic performance requirements and academic support resources for athletes.

**3. Accept what's not coming back.**

The world where unpaid college athletes generate billions for universities while prohibited from receiving compensation is over. Courts have ruled it illegal. State legislatures have intervened. The athletes themselves have won the moral argument. It's not returning, and it shouldn't.

The world where conferences remain stable based on tradition and geography is also over. Once you make television revenue the dominant competitive factor, realignment becomes inevitable. You can't put that genie back in the bottle.

**4. Ask better questions.**

Not: "How do we restore the old system?"   
But: "What kind of college football do we want going forward, and what rules would create it?"

Not: "Who destroyed college football?"   
But: "What values should college football serve, and how do we build structures that serve those values?"

Not: "How do we go back?"    
But: "How do we go forward in a way that's honest, fair, and sustainable?"

---

## The Uncomfortable Conclusion

College football's traditions weren't murdered by athletes seeking fair compensation or mobility rights. They were hollowed out over decades by institutions chasing television revenue and by a legal framework that finally collapsed under its own contradictions.

The athletes were the last to benefit from college football's commercialization, not the cause of it.

NIL and the transfer portal didn't destroy something healthy—they arrived at the end of a long decline, removing the final restrictions that maintained an increasingly hollow appearance of amateurism.

If you want to blame someone for the death of college football traditions, don't blame the 20-year-old linebacker accepting an NIL deal. Blame the administrators who realigned conferences for TV markets, the commissioners who negotiated billion-dollar media contracts while insisting athletes remain unpaid, the coaches earning $10 million while players couldn't sell their own jerseys, and the entire system that maintained the fiction of amateurism while building a commercial empire.

Or, more honestly: blame the fundamental contradictions at the heart of big-time college athletics, contradictions that were always going to collapse eventually. The only question was when and how.

That collapse is happening now. What matters is what comes next.
