## 1. Opening

On a cold January stage in Davos, Mark Carney delivered a line designed to travel: “nostalgia is not a strategy.” He coupled it with something sharper—middle powers, he warned, must learn to cooperate in new ways or risk being “on the menu” in a world where great powers set terms and everyone else pays them. Reporters quickly pulled out the headline phrases (“rupture, not a transition”) and the list of proposed fixes: issue-by-issue coalitions, “variable geometry” partnerships, buyers’ clubs for critical minerals, and cooperation on trade corridors and AI governance [1][9][16].

There’s a reason the speech landed. It does not read like a lament for the post–Cold War era; it reads like an instruction manual for living after it. Carney’s central claim is not that the old rules-based order is under strain (most leaders would concede that), but that it is **finished**—and that pretending otherwise is strategically disabling. The implied alternative is a “third path” sometimes described as **“values-based realism”**: keep democratic commitments and rule-of-law language, but act with the frankness of states that assume coercion, economic leverage, and technological rivalry are permanent features of the landscape [5][15].

The question is whether this is a workable doctrine or a well-tuned diagnosis with a policy agenda that cannot be executed at scale. A close read of the surrounding commentary—policy analysis, academic work on middle-power behavior, research on geoeconomic “resilience” tools, and studies of how crisis narratives can become self-fulfilling—points to a tiered result. 

- **The result:** Carney’s diagnosis of fragmentation is largely credible, but the prescriptions run into a coordination-and-capacity trap that middle powers (including Canada) routinely fail to escape. 
- **A secondary concern also emerges:** describing the moment as an irreversible rupture may itself increase the odds of the very fragmentation Carney wants to manage, by shifting expectations and encouraging preemptive alignment or hedging.

**That is a mixed conclusion in the literal sense: it credits the speech with seeing the world clearly, while doubting that the world Carney describes will reliably permit the kind of cooperation he calls for.**

To understand why, it helps to treat the doctrine less as a single argument than as a bundle of claims—about power, institutions, economic coercion, domestic politics, and the psychology of international order—and then watch where each claim holds up, and where it doesn’t. A recent investigation -- [our BFIH analysis]() -- tested these components against multiple streams of evidence, ranging from Canada’s trade exposure to peer-reviewed studies of supply-chain “decoupling,” and from middle-power strategy research to historical work on how talk of inevitability can accelerate collapse.

## 2. The Evidence

### The speech is vivid; the underlying “rupture” is real but unevenly distributed

Most immediate coverage of Carney’s remarks—whether in mainstream outlets or policy summaries—draws from the same source: the Davos transcript and the first wave of reactions. That matters because it limits what those articles can tell us. They are useful for pinning down what Carney said (“rupture,” “nostalgia,” “on the menu,” “issue by issue”), but they don’t independently verify that his framing matches the world [1][9][16]. They are descriptive, not diagnostic.

Where independent diagnosis begins is in the pattern Carney is trying to name: a world in which economic integration is increasingly weaponized, where security commitments are politically unstable, and where international institutions are less capable of enforcing rules that great powers find inconvenient. In that sense, the “rupture” claim is not a wild outlier; it’s an attempt to draw a clean line through a messy reality.

But the evidence also pushes toward a more precise reading: the order is not disappearing everywhere at once. Some of what Carney calls rupture is better understood as **selective enforcement**—rules still constrain smaller actors more reliably than bigger ones—and some is the growth of parallel systems (especially in technology standards and industrial policy) rather than the immediate collapse of existing ones. That unevenness matters because it determines which tools can plausibly work. A world in total free-fall rewards narrow survival strategies; a world in partial fragmentation still rewards institution-building in pockets.

Academic and policy work on middle-power behavior supports exactly this intermediate picture. Middle powers rarely behave as if one grand new order has replaced another; they hedge, shift, and exploit niches because the system is neither stable enough for idealistic universalism nor chaotic enough to make all rules irrelevant [35][36]. Even Carney’s own operational proposals—buyers’ clubs, trade-bridging, AI governance cooperation—implicitly rely on that middle condition: enough shared interest to coordinate, enough fear to motivate it.

This is where the doctrine’s strength is easiest to see. By focusing on practical “webs of connection” rather than a single redesign of global governance, Carney is describing a strategy that fits partial fragmentation [11]. The speech reads like an attempt to salvage cooperation without pretending the 1990s are recoverable [1][9]. If the only question were whether the world is more coercive and less predictable than it was, the evidence would comfortably support him.

The problem is that the doctrine is not only a diagnosis. It is also a set of prescriptions about what middle powers can do next—and that is where the evidence becomes less forgiving.

### Coalition-building works best in narrow lanes; the doctrine asks for something broader

Carney’s proposed remedy is coordination among “middle powers,” often through flexible, issue-specific coalitions rather than permanent blocs [1][11]. There are real-world examples that make this look feasible—especially when the task is bounded and the incentives are aligned.

The Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action, launched with World Bank support, is a useful benchmark precisely because it is limited: it creates a forum for finance ministries to share tools and coordinate messaging on climate-related fiscal policy, without requiring a full-spectrum alliance [44]. It demonstrates that middle-power coordination can be durable when the cost of entry is low, the agenda is technical, and the reputational payoff is clear.

Policy analysts have pointed to other templates. Some highlight India’s ability to build coalitions without fully binding alliances, and to diversify relationships without formal subordination—an approach often described as strategically flexible rather than “non-aligned” in the old sense [17]. Others note that inducements—positive incentives, not just threats—are a central feature of economic statecraft, and can be designed to draw partners into cooperation [45].

Academic work expands the menu further. “Active alignment” strategies, for example, envision middle powers shaping great-power competition by selectively aligning on issues, brokering standards, and using minilateral forums to convert leverage into rules [41]. In technology governance, research on “swing states” suggests that countries with technical capacity can gain influence by serving as intermediaries—drafting standards, certifying compliance, and translating between regulatory systems—rather than by leading formal blocs [42].

So the cooperative impulse in the Carney Doctrine is not fantasy. It matches a growing body of work that treats influence as something built from targeted capabilities, not just GDP rankings.

Yet these same literatures also clarify the doctrine’s implicit escalation in ambition. They describe coalition success mainly in settings where:

- the coalition’s purpose is concrete and narrow,
- the payoff arrives quickly enough to justify political cost,
- and defection can be detected and punished at manageable cost.

Carney’s rhetoric, by contrast, often gestures toward something closer to system-level redesign: bridging major trade frameworks, building collective resilience against coercion, and forming a dense mesh of partnerships strong enough to prevent great powers from picking off states one by one [4][11]. That is a harder problem than running a successful technical coalition. It requires not only shared interests but synchronized timelines, compatible domestic politics, and enough slack resources to absorb retaliation.

The evidence base on middle-power coordination is blunt about this. Analysts who study “minilateral eras”—periods when small-group coalitions proliferate because universal forums are gridlocked—find that coordination problems do not vanish; they migrate downward. Partners fear retaliation, calculate domestic blowback, and often prefer ambiguous hedging over visible alignment [21][32]. Even when leaders share the same analysis, their bureaucracies and electorates may not share the same risk tolerance. What looks like a coalition opportunity in a speech can become, in implementation, a collective action problem.

**That gap—between the success of narrow coalitions and the doctrine’s broader ambitions—is one of the main reasons the evidence tilts toward “right diagnosis, overreaching prescriptions.”**

### The coordination-and-capacity trap shows up in Canada’s own constraints

The doctrine’s strongest test case is Canada itself, because Canada is both the doctrine’s author and one of the archetypal “middle powers” it aims to mobilize. The Canadian constraint most frequently cited in policy analysis is structural dependence on the United States—economically, militarily, and institutionally.

One Chatham House analysis points to Canada’s muted reaction to U.S. naval actions and frames it through a hard number: roughly 67% export integration with the U.S. [6]. The exact figure can be debated depending on year and definition, but the underlying constraint is not in doubt: Canada’s prosperity is tightly coupled to access to the American market. That coupling limits how far Canada can credibly go in signaling strategic autonomy if autonomy risks triggering tariffs, regulatory friction, or informal punishment.

This isn’t only about trade. Defense modernization is a second bottleneck. Canada has announced significant spending increases—figures on the order of C$18 billion have circulated in defense commentary—but analysts stress that industrial capacity and procurement timelines can dilute the strategic effect of new spending for years [27]. A middle power can promise deterrence and resilience, but it cannot conjure shipyards, skilled labor, or munitions supply chains on demand.

Policy writers skeptical of the doctrine often reduce this to a single sentence: declaring autonomy without leverage invites pressure [48]. That may be too neat, but it captures the central implementation problem. Coalition leadership requires the capacity to absorb costs—retaliation, supply disruptions, political conflict—long enough for partners to believe the coalition will persist. If Canada itself cannot reliably pay those costs, its ability to lead “variable geometry” coalitions is narrower than the Davos rhetoric implies.

There is also a governance dimension. Some domestic critics argue that Carney-style statecraft risks technocratic overreach, pointing to episodes like large-scale spending through special warrants as evidence of bypassing parliamentary scrutiny [49]. That claim comes from an ideologically marked source, and it should not be treated as a neutral audit. But the underlying issue—foreign policy legitimacy depends on domestic trust and institutional process—is real. Coalitions abroad require coalitions at home, especially when economic security policy starts to look like industrial planning.

More careful treatments within Canada-focused policy analysis echo this point in less accusatory terms: the doctrine’s feasibility depends on specific domestic political alignments, cabinet cohesion, and the ability to sustain a cross-partisan story about why costs are worth paying [61]. In other words, even if the doctrine were strategically sound on paper, it is politically fragile in practice.

This is the coordination-and-capacity trap at the national level: the doctrine asks Canada to behave like a country with greater slack—economically diversified, militarily scalable, and domestically unified—than Canada typically is. The trap is not uniquely Canadian; it is the default condition of middle powers. Canada simply provides a clear example.

### Geoeconomic “resilience” is harder than speeches imply—and often produces unwanted side effects

A core operational promise in Carney’s program is resilience: reduce vulnerability to coercion by diversifying trade, coordinating on critical minerals, and shaping technology governance [4][11]. Here the evidence becomes sharply constraining, because the empirical literature on resilience tools is full of backfire.

Sanctions and market interventions can ricochet. The well-known Rusal sanctions episode is often cited as a case where U.S. action reshaped commodity markets in ways that were not cleanly aligned with U.S. interests, illustrating how difficult it is to target a node in a global supply chain without generating spillovers [63]. That is not an argument against sanctions per se; it is an argument against imagining that economic statecraft is a precision instrument.

Diversification is also less transformative than slogans suggest. Quantitative work on supply-chain reallocation during “triple crises” (pandemic disruption, geopolitical tensions, and other shocks) finds that even with visible efforts at “China+1,” core dependencies often persist through intermediates and tiered supply structures [64]. Network analyses of rare-earth dependencies make a similar point: vulnerabilities cluster in specific chokepoints, and diversifying raw material sources does not automatically resolve risk embedded in processing capacity, logistics, and specialized manufacturing [65].

Even large institutional tools can lose effectiveness under geopolitical stress. A study of EU funds suggests that rising geopolitical risk can meaningfully reduce the impact of cohesion-oriented financial instruments—effects on the order of tens of percentage points in some cases—because uncertainty changes investment behavior and policy traction [66]. The exact magnitudes depend on modeling choices, but the directional finding is consistent: risk environments blunt policy tools.

In the technology domain, “race” dynamics can invert the meaning of resilience. Work on “mutually assured deregulation” argues that when states dismantle safety oversight to gain competitiveness, they can propagate shared vulnerabilities rather than improve national security [68]. Again, the point is not that regulation always wins; it’s that in competitive environments, tools pursued under the banner of resilience can reduce systemic stability.

Taken together, this literature does not refute Carney’s resilience agenda. It does something more specific: it shows that resilience is rarely achieved by a single announced pivot. It is achieved by sustained, technically detailed, politically protected work—often with smaller gains than leaders hope, and with unintended consequences.

**This is the second reason the evidence leans away from the doctrine as a fully workable framework. Carney’s prescriptions are directionally plausible, but the empirical record suggests they will be slower, messier, and more failure-prone than the rhetoric of “new order” implies.**

There is, however, an important counterpoint: some tools do work under the right conditions. The growth of open standards—RISC‑V is one commonly cited example—shows that technological sovereignty can sometimes be enhanced through openness and ecosystem-building rather than through pure protectionism [69]. And research on China’s economic coercion suggests coercion can backfire by galvanizing alliances, creating exactly the kind of shared motivation coalitions need [67]. These are not guarantees. They are reminders that the doctrine’s feasibility depends heavily on issue area, timing, and institutional design.

### The biggest wild card is narrative: “rupture” talk can change behavior before policy does

Carney’s most quoted word is “rupture,” and the evidence suggests that word choice carries risk. The concern is not etiquette; it is behavior. When leaders describe a system as irreversibly broken, actors may begin to act as if rules no longer apply, accelerating the shift away from cooperative expectations.

Historical analogies are imperfect guides, but they are useful for identifying mechanisms. Margaret MacMillan’s work on the road to 1914 emphasizes how perceptions of inevitability and fear can narrow options and encourage preemptive moves [51]. That is not a claim that Davos rhetoric causes wars; it is a claim that expectations can harden into strategies.

Modern empirical work on crises supports the same mechanism in non-military settings. Retrospectives on the Asian financial crisis highlight how panic and shifting narratives can drive outcomes that fundamentals alone did not predict [52]. IMF work on early-warning systems underscores a related point: crisis prediction is hard partly because crises involve feedback loops—once people believe a crash is coming, they act in ways that bring it closer [53].

The connection to international order is straightforward. If middle powers and investors internalize a “post-order” story, they may prioritize bilateral protection, explicit great-power alignment, or defensive economic nationalism. **Research on hedging behavior in intensified U.S.–China rivalry shows that middle powers often respond to perceived systemic danger by tightening alignments, not by launching broad third-way coalitions [38]. That is exactly the opposite of Carney’s goal.**

Studies of narrative framing in other policy domains strengthen the warning. Work on AI governance argues that catastrophic imaginaries can narrow policy imagination and lock actors into brittle strategies [54]. Critiques of climate “doomism” similarly suggest that apocalyptic framing can induce paralysis or miscalibrated responses, even when the underlying risk is real [55]. The shared lesson is that public narratives do not merely describe; they constrain what actors feel able to do.

This does not mean leaders should sugarcoat. It means that there is a difference between diagnosing structural change and declaring closure on the old system. The evidence indicates a real risk that “rupture” framing, if widely adopted, could make cooperation harder at the margin—especially among states that are already risk-averse.

Importantly, this narrative mechanism is the main point on which reasonable evaluators diverge. Analysts who put narrative and expectation front and center tend to treat “rupture talk” as the doctrine’s most dangerous feature; analysts who emphasize material constraints treat it as a rhetorical flourish. The evidence suggests both are partly right: narrative effects are real but not omnipotent. They tend to matter most near tipping points—moments when actors are uncertain and looking for cues.

### Is “values-based realism” principled adaptation or a polished alibi?

A final dispute around the doctrine is moral rather than mechanical: is “values-based realism” a way to preserve democratic commitments under pressure, or a way to abandon them while keeping the language?

**The most skeptical commentary, especially from ideological outlets, treats the doctrine as an admission that the “rules-based order” was always a cover for power—and therefore that Carney’s new language merely rationalizes continuity with different branding** [3][12][19]. Some also emphasize Canada’s integration into U.S.-led security systems (Five Eyes, NATO) as proof that talk of autonomy is hollow [8].

Those critiques should not be dismissed out of hand, but they also cannot be treated as disinterested measurement. Their strongest contribution is to force a concrete test: if the doctrine claims to be values-based, where are the binding constraints? How, specifically, will values override interest when they conflict?

Here the academic evidence adds an unexpected twist. Scholarly work is relatively unsympathetic to the idea that the doctrine is *primarily* a values-wash. Research on middle-power strategy tends to assume that states pursue mixed motives—status, security, prosperity, and legitimacy—and that values talk often functions as one component of coalition-building rather than a pure mask [35][36]. In the investigation’s scoring of evidence streams, scholarly work was among the strongest counterweights to the “pure hypocrisy” interpretation.

At the same time, scholarship raises a different challenge: the concept of “middle power” itself may be analytically slippery, perhaps more historical label than stable category [14]. If “middle power” is not a coherent strategic identity, then a doctrine built around rallying “middle powers” risks targeting a constituency that does not reliably behave as a bloc. That conceptual critique undermines the doctrine’s organizing principle without relying on moral denunciation.

A more grounded moral critique appears in policy and theory commentary focused on soft power. Carney invokes elements that echo Joseph Nye—attraction, legitimacy, networks—but the evidence suggests soft power alone is increasingly insufficient in an era where coercion is more explicit [15]. That is not a moral indictment; it is a warning that values-based rhetoric must be paired with tangible leverage, or it becomes a liability.

**Taken together, the evidence points to a sober conclusion: the doctrine is not best understood as a cynical alibi, but neither is it a clean reconciliation of values and interests. It is an attempt to spend “principle” as political capital in service of coalition-building. _The risk is not only hypocrisy; it is overdraw_—promising more moral and strategic coherence than domestic politics and international bargaining will allow.**

## 3. What This Means

The most useful way to treat the Carney Doctrine is as a design prompt rather than a blueprint. It asks the right first question—*what do middle powers do when the old system stops reliably protecting them?*—but the evidence implies that the workable answers will be narrower, slower, and more conditional than the Davos rhetoric suggests.

For policymakers in middle powers, three practical implications follow.

**First, coalition-building is most reliable when it is engineered like infrastructure, not announced like destiny.** The success cases in the evidence base share an unglamorous feature: they create repeatable routines—shared metrics, procurement standards, information exchange, and credible triggers for collective action [44][42]. That means the doctrine’s “variable geometry” should be interpreted less as free-form flexibility and more as modular construction. Build one module (say, critical-mineral stockpiles with transparent rules), test it, then expand. If a coalition cannot survive its first retaliation episode or its first election cycle, it is not yet a strategic instrument.

**Second, “resilience” needs a defensive definition before it gets an offensive one.** The empirical literature shows that many resilience tools—sanctions, rapid diversification, heavy-handed industrial policy—carry predictable side effects [63][64][65]. Middle powers should therefore start by specifying which vulnerabilities they are willing to live with. Total de-risking is usually unattainable; partial de-risking is often enough if it targets the right chokepoints. **In practice, that shifts strategy from “leave dependence behind” to “make dependence less coercible.”**

**Third, narrative is itself a policy lever.** Carney’s “rupture” language may motivate action, but it can also narrow options by triggering fatalism or preemptive alignment [53][38][54]. Leaders who adopt the doctrine would be wise to separate two messages: the internal message (used to mobilize bureaucracies and budgets) can be stark, while the external message (used to preserve room for cooperation) should avoid suggesting that rules are dead everywhere. In a system where expectations can cascade, tone is not cosmetic.

For Canada specifically, the doctrine’s constraint mapping implies a strategic posture closer to brokerage than to autonomy. Canada has assets—resource wealth, institutional capacity, diplomatic reach—that can make it a valuable coalition partner [18][61]. But Canada’s high exposure to U.S. market access and defense integration means it is less free to stage dramatic autonomy plays than the doctrine’s rhetoric invites [6][48]. The practical Canadian version of the doctrine would likely emphasize: (1) deepening North American resilience in ways that are legible to Washington, (2) selective diversification that reduces single-point failures rather than chasing symbolic independence, and (3) leading technical coalitions (finance, standards, minerals transparency) where Canada’s credibility is higher than its coercive power.

**For readers thinking beyond any one country, the evidence points toward a menu of middle-power strategies that differ in risk and feasibility:**

| Strategy | Known for | Upside | Main vulnerability | Best fit conditions |
|--:|---|---|---|---|
| **Issue-specific coalitions** | Technical cooperation and modular alliances | High feasibility in narrow lanes | Hard to scale into system-level influence | Shared standards, measurable goals, low entry cost [44] |
| **Hedging** | Strategic ambiguity and diversified ties | Preserves autonomy under uncertainty | Can look unreliable to partners | High exposure to retaliation; divided domestic politics [35][36] |
| **Active alignment / brokerage** | Shaping competition through selective alignment | Converts niche leverage into rules | Requires administrative competence and credibility | Strong institutions; sectoral expertise [41][42] |
| **Full-spectrum coalition leadership** | Building broad “third-way” blocs | Potentially reshapes regional order | Expensive; coordination failure likely | High slack resources; aligned electorates; shared threat perception [21][32] |

**The doctrine’s ambition sits mostly in the bottom row. The evidence suggests most states will live in the top three.**

This reframing also changes how to judge success. If the doctrine is evaluated as a plan to organize a new global order, it will likely disappoint. If it is evaluated as a disciplined way to build partial protections in a fragmenting system—while avoiding rhetoric that accelerates fragmentation—it becomes more plausible, and more useful.

---

## 4. Closing

Perhaps the deepest finding here isn’t about Canada, or Davos, or even middle powers. It’s about what strategy means when the object you are strategizing about reacts to your description of it.

Carney’s doctrine is written in the language of realism—coercion, leverage, survival—but it is haunted by something realists sometimes underplay: reflexivity. States do not merely respond to a changing order; they help manufacture the order by what they signal, what they coordinate, and what they declare finished. The “rupture” word captures a truth about fragmentation, but it also risks hardening that truth into a script.

The evidence does not suggest that leaders should retreat into euphemism. It suggests a more demanding form of clarity: diagnose structural change without narrating inevitability; build coalitions as working machines rather than moral pageants; treat resilience as a technical craft rather than a slogan.

What remains genuinely uncertain is not whether the world is rougher than it was. It is whether middle powers can cultivate the patience—domestically and diplomatically—to do slow coordination in an era that rewards fast reactions. **The next few years may show that the decisive resource is not military spending or trade share, but political attention: the capacity to keep building, quietly, after the headlines move on.**
