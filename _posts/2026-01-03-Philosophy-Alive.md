*"From the Ancients to AI - Now is Philosophy more relevant than ever, or dead? (generated by Perplexity.ai).*

From [a conversation with Gemini Pro 3.0, using Perplexity.AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/philosophy-s-vast-richness-avA8jGcZRNeEKAGD_ZIXWg#7), I segued into a request for a BFIH analysis.  It didn't disappoint!

Well, right up until I read through the cited sources, and tried to sort through the jumble of incorrect URLs it compiled as footnotes for the synopsis below. I learned a lot going to each of the originally generated sources of thee interactive session and finding the appropriate ones to swap in as correct URLs in those footnotes. Time-consuming but part and parcel what's necessary to trust your AI-generated reports.

**The research question:**

> **_"Is Philosophy dead?"_**

**The upshot:** Yes -- and I learned something....

Below is the plain-language synopsis of the BFIH findings, which includes a link to the full BFIH analysis report with bibliography.
