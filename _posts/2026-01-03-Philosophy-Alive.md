*"From the Ancients to AI - Now is Philosophy more relevant than ever, or dead? (generated by Perplexity.ai).*

---

From [a conversation with Gemini Pro 3.0, using Perplexity.AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/philosophy-s-vast-richness-avA8jGcZRNeEKAGD_ZIXWg#7), I segued into a request for a BFIH analysis.  It didn't disappoint!

Well, right up until I read through the cited sources, and tried to sort through the jumble of incorrect URLs it compiled as footnotes for the first version of the synopsis. I learned a lot going to each of the originally generated sources of the interactive session and finding the appropriate ones to swap in as correct URLs in those footnotes. Time-consuming but often what's necessary to trust your AI-generated reports.  Ultimately, though, I decided to prompt the AI system through another iteration of review and critique.  

- The review included RAG based upon a markdown transcript of [the interactive Perplexity.AI session](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/philosophy-s-vast-richness-avA8jGcZRNeEKAGD_ZIXWg#0), which contains the exact URLs returned by its internal Google searches. The AI system created a new Python script to deterministcally match each report citation with a verified URL.
- The critique came next and was eye-opening. I include it below in the ["Caveats"](#caveats) section. It is a cautionary reminder that it actually takes genuine expertise in the field of inquiry to judge how valid each of these AI-generated reports really are.

**The research question:**

> **_"Is philosophy "dead" in the sense that all meritorious ideas about human existence have been exhaustively explored, leaving only recombinations?"_**

**The upshot:** Far from it -- and I learned something....
