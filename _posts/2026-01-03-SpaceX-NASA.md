I wanted to learn a bit more about the structure of the NASA and SpaceX deals. The narrative that the private sector is somehow inherently better at all things than the public sector presents itself as an easy strawman to poke holes through. So, I turned to BFIH for a more complete analysis from different perspectives, posing different hypotheses, being as thorough as possible at seeking out all relevant evidence whether for or against any particular hypothesis, and then just turning the Bayesian computational crank to see where it sorted out. In the process, I was sure to uncover plenty of sources to read up on.

**The research question:**

> **_"SpaceX epitomizes the best of private ventures achieving global-scale goals as well as creating capital value in a way that public/gov't agencies cannot."_**

**The upshot:** NASA & SpaceX have had a mutually beneficial partnership.

**Caveats:** *__Beware errors!__ In my customary review of the contents and sources cited by the AI-generated BFIH reports on this topic, I found some discrepancies between the attribution of SpaceX funding to specific government contracts as stated in the report and those reported elsewhere. The ones I found in the synopsis also had footnotes to relevant but the wrong sources. These inaccuracies do not change the analysis conclusions or the upshot of the synopsis, but they are errors. I verify a few uncovered by my manual investigation of the sources in the report and those found by my targeted Google AI Mode searches. But, frankly, some errors persist in these reports because I've gotten what I want out of my manual queries and don't want to spend the time editing the documents.*

Below is the plain-language synopsis of the BFIH findings, which includes a link to the full BFIH analysis report with bibliography.
