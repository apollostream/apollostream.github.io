Oscar Peterson is one of my all-time favorite musicians.  I used to have a bunch of his LPs back in the day -- college through grad school.  I just love the flow -- the singing of the fingers of --  his playing.

Sometimes you just want external validation that what you feel in your heart is true is also generally recognized by those in-the-know as true.  That's how I felt when I posed this to my ['BFIH Tournament' web app](https://bfih-game2-711582453480.us-east5.run.app). 

By the way, per the BFIH web app: I've worked a lot with Anthropic's Claude Code to improve the app's formation of hypotheses, assignment of priors and likelihoods, and writing of engaging yet still accurate and information-dense synopses.  The synopsis below comes from the app employing OpenAI's GPT-5.2 -- the first one done without Perplexity AI in the mix at all.

**The research topic:**

> **_"Oscar Peterson has a special place among the pantheon of jazz piano greats because of his uniquely lyrical and virtuosic style."_**

**The upshot:** Yes. And I agree. I encourage you to spend time and dwell on the sources referenced in the Bibliography.
