I believe it takes tremendous passion to deliver the perfection needed to achieve excellence in any domain. But we all have limited resources, and so we must pick our battles: Sometimes just doing well is good enough.

Context matters a lot in determining when to strive for perfection. What I like about the BFIH analysis discussed below is that it thoroughly vetted the source material to enumerate the different contexts and how the trade off of seeking perfection with mere satisficing shifts with context and values.

By the way, the in-depth BFIH analysis behind all of this was performed using my Claude Code-generated web app ['BFIH Tournament'](https://bfih-game2-711582453480.us-east5.run.app), which leverages OpenAI models, esp. GPT-5.2. I didn't like the app-generated synopsis -- a bit redundant an uninteresting -- so I ran both it and the full BFIH analysis report through [Perplexity.AI "Research" mode](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/read-the-attached-thoroughly-c-pvxL7fjWS92vifCCkuOKug?sm=d#2). And using the same prompt that the app gave GPT-5.2, I had Perplexity.AI generate the synopsis below. I prefer it over what the app generated.

**The research topic:**

> **_"Reserve the pursuit of perfection for those things you are most passionate about; and for the rest, don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good."_**

**The upshot:** In the end, it comes down to your own personal dance between passion, requirements, and constraints.
