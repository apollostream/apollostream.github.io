Here's an old standby proposition that I've been testing my methodology against for about 3 years:

- **_"Tom Brady is the NFL GOAT."_**

**The upshot:** Yes! ... and no....

Over the years, I'd done this Brady-GOAT analyses a dozen times or so, and it would always say "Yes, that's true." But it wasn't until I beefed up BFIH to adopt a "multi-paradigm" approach did it give a different take: "Maybe Jerry Rice is the GOAT."  Read on to see why.

This is one of those analyses that really makes you appreciate the multi-paradigm approach that BFIH takes. It adopts a baseline paradigm -- i.e. viewpoint or perspective -- to set its background knowledge and biases as context, to pose hypotheses, assign priors, decide what evidence to pursue, and assess likelihoods of the evidence with respect to each hypothesis. However, it doesn't stop there. It also probes alternative viewpoints (paradigms) and does the same. It then synthesizes the results. Each viewpoint can come to the party with different priors and likelihoods but they must all agree upon what hypotheses are considered and what constitutes evidence -- the same set of shared observable facts.

Below is its plain-language synopsis of its findings, followed by a link to the full BFIH analysis.
