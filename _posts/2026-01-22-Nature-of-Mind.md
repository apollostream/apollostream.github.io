Over the years of using large language models (LLM) as AI researchers, I've flipped back and forth between having them do analyses of a one-off topic or proposition and having them iterate over multiple propositions that it ties together in a causal network. 

This week, while working with Claude Code to polish up our BFIH Tournament web app, I paused and asked it to reflect upon the app, the code base and what it thought of it all including its ideas for what to do next. 

Claude Code responded with a surprisingly introspective answer.

**The research topic:**

> **_"Oscar Peterson has a special place among the pantheon of jazz piano greats because of his uniquely lyrical and virtuosic style."_**

**The upshot:** Yes. And I agree. I encourage you to spend time and dwell on the sources referenced in the Bibliography.
