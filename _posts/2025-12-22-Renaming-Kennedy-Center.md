I'm bothered by the renaming of the Kennedy Center.  After all, there's a law by Congress that prevents it. And there are the descendants of John F. Kennedy who are insulted by it.

So, I put this proposition through the BFIH analysis process with Perplexity.ai in "Research" mode:

- *"The renaming of the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. to include Donald Trump's name may be unprecedented but is harmless."*


**The upshot:** BFIH concludes that the harm is as bad as I suspected.

Below is its plain-language synopsis of its findings, followed by a link to the full BFIH analysis.
