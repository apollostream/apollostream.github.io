I'll end Year 2025 with a post spawned by a brief text exchange with a family member. (Always remember that statistics are comprised of real events in real people's everyday lives....)  

Two of my previous posts note how anomalous 2025 has been with respect to federal governance in America. This one sums it all up with a call for vigilance by all Americans as we embark upon 2026.

**The research question:**

> **_"What is the nature and magnitude of changes to constitutional enforcement mechanisms in 2025, and what do these changes imply for the realization of constitutional protections for different populations?"_**

**The upshot:** It's not good but **_watch for evidence in 2026_** for a definitive answer.

- *This analysis was crafted from a more complicated than typical interactive session with Perplexity Pro. See for yourself:*
  - *Perplexity Pro session ["Inflection-Point-2025"](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/you-are-a-world-class-bfih-bay-XLv.cYptQFe0esG6fKgUdA#0), including the prompts and documents input & generated*.
- Some of the language used in both the synopsis and the final report is stronger than the quantitative results would suggest. This is because I corrected the numbers after the report and synopsis were AI-generated based upon erroneous treatment of all 22 pieces of evidence as conditionally independent given any hypothesis. The correct calculations were made later by a manually edited Python script treating the 4 evidence clusters as conditionally independent given any hypothesis. This change to the correct calculations weakened the support of the dominant hypothesis considerably but that hypothesis, **H4**, retained strong support and had a posterior probability nearly double that of each of the next two hypotheses, which were roughly equal:
  - **H4 (Regime Transformation Through Institutional Capture): 42%** (prior: 10%)
  - H5 (Unitary Executive Authority): 23% (prior: 15%)
  - H3 (Stress Test with Recovery): 22% (prior: 20%)
  - H2 (Gradual Erosion): 12% (prior: 25%)
  - H1 (Constitutional Continuity): 0.00% (prior: 25%)
- Keep in mind that in all of these BFIH analyses the quantitative values are only intended to inform the resulting narrative about the insights and conclusions. So exact values don't matter but relative magnitudes, esp. in terms of log-odds do (e.g., weight of evidence).

Below is the plain-language synopsis of the BFIH findings, which includes a link to the full BFIH analysis report with bibliography.
