I'll end Year 2025 with a post spawned by a brief text exchange with a family member.  Two of my previous posts note how anomalous 2025 has been with respect to federal governance in America. This one sums it all up with a call for vigilance by all Americans as we embark upon 2026.

**The proposition:**

> **_"Are American citizens' constitutional guarantees substantially realized in their lived experience, and has 2025 marked a structural change in how federal institutions constrain executive power?"_**

**The upshot:** It's complicated -- **be watchful for more evidence in 2026.**

*This analysis was born from one of the more complicated interactive sessions with Perplexity Pro that I've had. See for yourself:*

- *Perplexity Pro session ["Inflection-Point-2025"](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/you-are-a-world-class-bfih-bay-XLv.cYptQFe0esG6fKgUdA#15), including the prompts and documents input & generated*.

Below is the plain-language synopsis of the BFIH findings; and here's a link to the full BFIH analysis ["Inflection-Point-2025-Full-Report.pdf"]().
