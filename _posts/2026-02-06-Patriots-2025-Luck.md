With the NFL's Super Bowl coming up on Sunday, I couldn't help but marvel at how charmed of a season the New England Patriots have had -- not too unlike that of the 2021-2022 Cincinnati Bengals.  To me, it seemed like everything fell their way. Sure they're a solid team but 14-3 regular season solid? AFC Champions solid?!

Well, what better topic to sic the [**BFIH Tournament** app](https://bfih-game2-711582453480.us-east5.run.app/) on. Especially because, with the help of Claude Code, I've improved some of its inner workings.

**The proposition to analyze:**

> **_"The 2025-2026 New England Patriots had an extraordinarily fortuitous path -- soft schedule, weak division, injury-depleted opponents, exceptionally uninjured & available starters, fortuitous close-game endings, etc. -- to Super Bowl LX."_**

**The upshot:** Sure, luck played a part -- it always does in a championship season -- but they were good, too. And that's the way the NFL likes it....
