This issue was brought to my attention by a friend. With this blog, I don't intend to dwell on the many things I think are wrong in current American governance but I do think the BFI approach draws bare attention to how egregious the current administration operates as a matter of course.  It's a shame to normalize behavior so beyond the pale.

And rather than insist that a post like this is not mere partisan griping but a genuine concern for what American's normalize as our government, I let the synopsis of this proposition's BFIH analysis invoke more of the methodological justification for its words than I typically would. I typically leave that for the full analysis report.  The full intellectual honesty of BFIH reveals whatever biases and competing viewpoints (i.e., multi-paradigm lenses) went into the analysis.

**The proposition:**

> _"The Trump administration pauses wind projects off New England, New York and Virginia (described here: https://www.npr.org/2025/12/22/g-s1-103320/offshore-wind-power-pause-trump-administration-new-england-new-york-virginia-national-security) is merely an example of customary tensions between the American federal government and state governments."_

**The upshot:** The proposition is found to be, unsurprisingly, **false**: this goes beyond customary tensions.  Read on for why and the implications....

Below is its plain-language synopsis of its findings, including a link to the full BFIH analysis.
