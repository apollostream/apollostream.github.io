This issue was brought to my attention by a friend. With this blog, I don't intend to dwell on the many things I think are wrong in politics but I do think the BFI approach draws bare attention to how eggregious the current administration operates as matter of course.  It's a shame to normalize behavior so beyond the pale.

That's why I let the plain-language synopsis of this one invoke more of the methodological justification for its words, which is something I typically leave for the full analysis report.
