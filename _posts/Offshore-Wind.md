This issue was brought to my attention by a friend. With this blog, I don't intend to dwell on the many things I think are wrong in current American governance but I do think the BFI approach draws bare attention to how egregious the current administration operates as a matter of course.  It's a shame to normalize behavior so beyond the pale.

Yet, many folks'll just say this is partisan griping. That's why I let the plain-language synopsis of this one invoke more of the methodological justification for its words, which is something I typically leave for the full analysis report.  The full intellectual honesty of BFIH reveals whatever biases went into the analysis.

**The proposition:**

> _"The Trump administration pauses wind projects off New England, New York and Virginia (described here: https://www.npr.org/2025/12/22/g-s1-103320/offshore-wind-power-pause-trump-administration-new-england-new-york-virginia-national-security) is merely an example of customary tensions between the American federal government and state governments."_

**The upshot:** The proposition is found to be, unsurprisingly, **false**.  Read on for why and the implications....

Below is its plain-language synopsis of its findings, including a link to the full BFIH analysis.
