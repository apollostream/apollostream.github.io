Back in the 1990's, I was introduced to Bayesian concepts by the computer scientists at MIT CSAIL (Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) while I was in graduate school. So, I learned Bayesian framing first from a viewpoint of cognitive science and computational knowledge representation, reasoning, and decision-making under uncertainty. It wasn't until later along the way of application and research that I encountered it as a data-first statistical modeling methodology. I've always taken to that knowledge-first way as being intuitive to me. Ever since I've been trying to impress upon folks the value of taking this viewpoint, but with limited success.  

I think this knowledge-first decision-centric perspective allows you to map the general meta-level concepts down to instantiations as context-specific problem-solving models and applied methods.

Unsatisfied with the extent I've been able to fully articulate my perspective on Bayesian framing, I gave it a shot with the Perplexity.ai LLM-based AI system. And,....

Well, I'm not wholly satisfied with the results but I think it does get partially there. The results below overstate Bayesian pervasiveness -- given what I've read from authors pushing back on the claims stated below. And yet, it doesn't fully capture the essence of Bayesian framing as I see it either.

This failure of the AI-generated analysis to capture the richness of a domain is common. As such, it sits as a cautionary tale as to the extent that you can trust the content of all the posts I generate with AI. Keep that in mind as you read this blog in general. Ultimately, this is all still a work in progress.

But, it still represents something useful -- and, as you can tell from [the full Perplexity session](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/generate-an-in-depth-discussio-tNxbRtbrRgGomO6dnAFG3w#23) -- it sure took me a lot of effort just to get this. So, I've decided to post it anyway.

**The proposition:**

- **_"Bayesian framing represents the epitome of robustness for knowledge-first decision-making under uncertainty."_**

**The upshot:** Under the right conditions, sure.

Below is the plain-language synopsis of the BFIH findings, which includes a link to the full analysis report with bibliography.
