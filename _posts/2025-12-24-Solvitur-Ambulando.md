Almost two years ago, I realized that I'd allowed "the perfect" -- vigorous daily physical workouts -- to become the enemy of "the good" -- just not being sedentary. I was spending hour after hour each day deriving math models, reading journal articles, watching conference presentations, and writing code. All while sitting.

Along the way, I found much in the medical literature to read about the benefits of walking. And I also learned about this topic:

- **_"'Solvitur ambulando' encapsulates the holistic benefits of regularly walking."_**

**The upshot:** Yes indeed, and in so many ways.

I've had an LLM-based AI agent perform an intellectually honest analysis of this topic before earlier this year but I wanted to see what a multi-paradigm analysis would reveal. It didn't disappoint! Though I wish it had mentioned the benefits of a 10-minute walk right after eating.

Below is its plain-language synopsis of its findings, followed by a link to the full BFIH analysis.
