I've done [the post on the New England Patriots](https://apollostream.github.io/Patriots-2025-Luck/), who'll play in the NFL's Super Bowl coming up on Sunday. But, how about their opponents, the Seattle Seahawks? It's interesting that the "Oh, they're just lucky" narrative floating around the Patriots isn't also haunting the Seahawks.

So, I simply swapped out "New England Patriots" for "Seattle Seahawks" and posed the topic to the [**BFIH Tournament** app](https://bfih-game2-711582453480.us-east5.run.app/) again.

**The proposition to analyze:**

> **_"The 2025-2026 Seattle Seahawks had an extraordinarily fortuitous path -- soft schedule, weak division, injury-depleted opponents, exceptionally uninjured & available starters, fortuitous close-game endings, etc. -- to Super Bowl LX."_**

**The upshot:** Similar conclusion to that of the Patriots, but it did seem to lean into team performance moreso than with the Patriots.
